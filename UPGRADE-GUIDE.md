# ContentForge Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading 4.1.0 → 4.1.1 (docs release)

**No functional changes.** 4.1.1 is documentation: 11 README translations
(version-stamped and guard-checked), the real validated-run artifacts embedded
in the README, full OpenAI-surface (Codex/ChatGPT) documentation, and a
per-surface updating table. Nothing to migrate.

---

## Upgrading 4.0.0 → 4.1.0 (two new surfaces)

**No breaking changes, nothing migrates.** 4.1.0 adds install surfaces only:
Grok (xAI Build CLI) native manifests, and five hero skills packaged as
claude.ai-uploadable `.skill` release assets. Existing installs, brands, runs,
and stores are untouched. If you use claude.ai alongside your main install,
grab the hero skills from the
[latest release](https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu/releases/latest).

---

## Upgrading 3.x → 4.0.0 (the lifecycle release)

**No breaking changes.** 4.0 is additive: existing brands, runs, artifacts, and
configurations work unchanged. What to know:

- **Nothing migrates and nothing is required.** The lifecycle stores start
  empty and fill as you use them: the first recorded `/contentforge:audit-content`
  creates `audits/`, the first `cf-aeo-check` keeps building `aeo/checks.json`
  exactly as before, and each new pipeline run writes its telemetry companions.
- **Pre-4.0 runs read as `not_instrumented` in telemetry** — unknown, never
  zero. Advisories only begin once ≥3 instrumented runs exist for a brand (the
  recurrence floor).
- **`brand_pages` gains, never loses.** The post-Gate-1 merge upserts verified
  pages with freshness stamps and never overwrites your manual curation;
  harvested conversion candidates appear under `brand_pages.recon_candidates`
  awaiting your confirmation — review them after your first 4.0 run.
- **`cf-calendar --from-audit=latest` now requires a recorded audit.** If you
  relied on running audit + calendar in one conversation, nothing changes
  except that it now also works in two.
- **On Cowork, run `/contentforge:cf-cowork-setup`** (or confirm it has run):
  the lifecycle stores ride the brand-directory Drive sync, and without it they
  vanish with the sandbox at session end.

---

## Scripts (New)

v3.0.0 introduces a `scripts/` directory with Python utilities:

- **`setup.py`** — Run it manually (`python scripts/setup.py`) when you want to check your install. Validates Python version, reports paths, checks `.mcp.json`. It does **not** run on its own — ContentForge has shipped an empty `hooks.json` since v3.9.0, so nothing fires at session start
- **`connector-status.py`** — Registry of 29 connectors across 14 categories. Powers `/contentforge:cf-integrations` and `/contentforge:cf-connect`

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+ (available in Cowork VM as Python 3.10)

---

## Verification Steps

After upgrading, verify everything works:

1. `python scripts/setup.py` — Run it yourself; should report your Python version and resolved paths
2. `/contentforge:cf-integrations` — A fresh install shows **0 connected** connectors: `.mcp.json` ships empty by design. Add the ones you want with `/contentforge:cf-connect <name>` from the 16-connector catalog in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`
3. `/contentforge:create-content` — Existing pipeline should work unchanged
4. `/contentforge:social-adapt [article]` — Should generate social posts
5. `/contentforge:cf-brief "AI tools"` — Should generate content brief

---

## Recommended Adoption Path

1. **Start with** `/contentforge:cf-integrations` — understand your connector status
2. **Try** `/contentforge:social-adapt` — immediate value from existing content
3. **Try** `/contentforge:cf-brief` — better briefs lead to better content
4. **Explore** `/contentforge:publish` — if you have Webflow/WordPress connectors
5. **Set up** `/contentforge:cf-analytics` — start tracking quality trends
6. **When ready** — `/contentforge:translate`, `/contentforge:cf-video-script`, `/contentforge:cf-calendar`

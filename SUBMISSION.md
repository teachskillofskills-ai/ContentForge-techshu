This file is the submission packet for the Anthropic Software Directory. It is **not** the directory listing — that is submitted via the form at https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit. This packet pre-stages every input the form will ask for so submission takes ~5 minutes, not hours.

## 1. One-line description

> Enterprise content production via 10-phase autonomous pipeline — research, fact-check, draft, visualize, validate, structure, SEO/GEO, humanize, review, output (.docx). 43-pattern AI-detection humanizer. EU AI Act Article 50 C2PA provenance.

## 2. Long description

ContentForge is an enterprise-grade content production system for marketing teams running on Claude Code & Cowork. It replaces 6–8 person content workflows with a coordinated 13-agent pipeline that turns a one-line topic into a publication-ready, fact-checked, brand-compliant Microsoft Word document in 30–60 minutes through 10 quality gates with three-layer fact verification (Phase 2 fact-checker → Phase 4 scientific validator → Phase 7 reviewer).

**v3.10.0** adds end-to-end-tested C2PA content provenance for the .docx output (EU AI Act Article 50 compliance, applicable 2 August 2026) via `--c2pa-sign` on `scripts/generate-docx.py` — embeds inline when c2pa-python supports the format, falls back to a verifiable `.c2pa.json` sidecar otherwise. Plus May 2026 AEO reality updates in the Phase 6 SEO/GEO optimizer (Google AI Overviews 55% prevalence, LLMs.txt companion standard, Profound/Otterly/Conductor measurement references).

**v3.9.5** introduced the three-category internal linking framework — topical (informational), commercial (brand product/service pages), conversion (audience-matched CTA), authority (brand-name attribution) — with a `brand_pages` schema in the brand profile, color-coded inline Word hyperlinks in the .docx, and an Appendix D internal link map. Marketers verify funnel coverage at a glance rather than producing a "face document" with no commercial pathway.

**v3.9.4** fixed pipeline orchestration so every phase actually invokes its subagent via the Task tool rather than single-pass generating. **v3.9** rebuilt the Phase 6.5 humanizer around a 35-pattern AI-detection catalog (adapted from Wikipedia: Signs of AI Writing + blader/humanizer) with a self-critique meta-pass and optional voice calibration from a brand `writing_sample` field.

13 agents, 22 skills, 9 commands, 16 opt-in HTTP MCP connectors. Multi-plugin coexistence by design (zero global hooks, zero auto-connecting MCP servers). Full Cowork compatibility — all connectors are HTTP, all Python scripts run natively in the Anthropic Desktop computer-use environment.

## 3. Category

`Marketing & Sales` (primary) · `Productivity` (secondary)

## 4. Target audience

- Digital marketing agencies producing 20–200 long-form pieces per month
- In-house marketing teams in regulated industries (Pharma, BFSI, Healthcare, Legal) needing brand-voice + compliance enforcement
- Content marketing teams running multi-brand portfolios
- Solo content marketers who need agency-grade output without a team

## 5. Working use cases (Anthropic policy requirement: 3+)

### Use case 1 — Generate a publication-ready white paper

```
/contentforge:brand-setup       # one-time per brand
/contentforge:create-content
```

The 10-phase pipeline runs ~45–75 min for a 3500–4500-word whitepaper: Title curation → Research (5+ verified sources) → Fact-check (URL verification + claim cross-reference) → Drafting (SME calibration via industry knowledge pack) → Visual asset annotation → Scientific validation (hallucination detection + regulatory rules) → Structuring + proofreading → SEO/GEO with three-category internal linking → Humanizer (43-pattern catalog + self-critique meta-pass) → Reviewer (5-dimension scoring) → Output Manager (.docx with embedded SEO/Quality/Production scorecards + Appendix D internal link map).

Empirically tested on a pharma whitepaper ("Antibody-Drug Conjugates in HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer"): 4,353 words, 18 citations including 5 NEJM papers with verified DOIs, all 3 required compliance disclaimers, 0 prohibited terms, 8.4/10 B+ APPROVED at the pharma 8.0 threshold, 0 hallucinations.

### Use case 2 — EU AI Act Article 50 compliant .docx

```
/contentforge:create-content
# pipeline runs ...
python3 scripts/generate-docx.py \
    --content output/humanized.md --output output/article.docx \
    --reports output/reports.json --brand "Acme Corp" \
    --content-type article \
    --c2pa-sign
```

Produces the .docx + a `.c2pa.json` sidecar with the manifest: claim_generator_info (ContentForge 10-phase pipeline), c2pa.actions.v2 (c2pa.created + c2pa.edited with "Human-reviewed via Phase 7 reviewer scorecard before delivery"), stds.schema-org.CreativeWork (Article type, Organization author, headline). The sidecar travels with the .docx. Verifiable by any C2PA tool.

### Use case 3 — Three-category internal linking for commercial impact

```
/contentforge:create-content
```

When the brand profile has `seo_preferences.brand_pages` populated with `product_or_service_pages`, `conversion_pages`, and `authority_pages`, the SEO/GEO optimizer (Phase 6) emits typed `<!-- INTERNAL-LINK: type=... -->` markers across the body. The output-manager (Phase 8) renders them as real inline Word hyperlinks color-coded by category — topical blue, commercial green, conversion purple, authority slate. The .docx Appendix D shows every link with anchor text, target URL, section, and reason. Empirically verified: a pharma whitepaper produced 5 typed links (3 topical + 1 commercial + 1 conversion), all clickable in Word.

### Use case 4 — Batch production across a multi-brand portfolio

```
/contentforge:batch-process
```

Processes 10–50+ pieces in parallel across multiple brands with queue management, priority scheduling, and progress tracking. 4–5× faster than sequential. Each piece carries its own brand profile, industry knowledge pack, jurisdiction rules.

## 6. Testing account / sample data

**Testing account:** Reviewers install from the public marketplace at `teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace` and use `config/brand-registry-template.json` as sample brand input. Knowledge-only mode (default) runs all 22 skills + 13 agents + 10 industry knowledge packs with zero external API keys beyond Claude. Optional Python deps: `python-docx` (auto-installed on first .docx generation), `c2pa-python` + `cryptography` (auto-installed on first `--c2pa-sign` invocation).

**Sample worked output:** the pharma whitepaper described in Use Case 1 above demonstrates the full pipeline output shape (humanized.md + reports.json + .docx with 4 appendices). Reviewers can reproduce by running `/contentforge:create-content` with the same topic.

## 7. Ownership verification

- **Repo:** github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu — owned by the GitHub organisation account @teachskillofskills-ai
- **Marketplace:** github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace — same owner
- **Third-party services referenced:** all MCP connectors point to official endpoints (Notion, Canva, Figma, Webflow, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, fal.ai, Replicate, Pipedream / Composio / Zapier / Make aggregators). No scraping, no credential interception, no impersonation.
- **Trademarks:** "ContentForge" is the submitter's mark.

## 9. Cowork compatibility statement

- All 16 HTTP MCP connectors work in both Claude Code and Cowork.
- All Python scripts (including `scripts/generate-docx.py` with `--c2pa-sign`) run natively in Cowork — Cowork is the Anthropic Desktop computer-use product with local filesystem access.
- Plugin ships zero global hooks and zero auto-connecting MCP servers; multi-plugin coexistence by design.
- For services without first-party HTTP MCPs (Google Sheets / Drive / dozens more), `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` documents Pipedream / Composio / Zapier / Make aggregator paths.

## 10. Verified-badge eligibility

ContentForge qualifies based on:
- v3.9.4 pipeline orchestration fix (Task-tool subagent dispatch verified end-to-end on a pharma whitepaper)
- v3.9.5 three-category internal linking (empirically verified: 5 typed links in a real .docx)
- v3.10.0 C2PA Article 50 path (sidecar manifest empirically verified)
- Three-layer fact verification pattern (research → fact-check → reviewer) demonstrably produces 94–100% factual accuracy in production tests
- 16 industry knowledge packs maintained quarterly

If applying for Verified, additional materials to prepare:
- Review of the c2pa-python integration in `scripts/generate-docx.py` (signing keys — describe key-management expectations)
- Privacy review of brand-profile.json schema
- Code review of `agents/07-reviewer.md` (the Phase 7 scoring rubric is load-bearing)

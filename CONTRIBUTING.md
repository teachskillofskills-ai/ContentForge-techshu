# Contributing to ContentForge

This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to ContentForge.

> **Who this is for.** These repositories are the TechShu line of the marketing plugins:
> maintained by the TechShu AI team at Indus Net TechShu Digital Pvt. Ltd. for TechShu
> delivery teams. Changes normally come from inside TechShu — branch in this repository
> rather than forking. The repositories are public so colleagues can install without a
> GitHub account; outside issues and pull requests are welcome but are reviewed on
> TechShu's roadmap, not a community one.
>
> If you are a marketer rather than a developer, you do not need this document — see the
> README for installing and using the plugin.

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

**For agent changes:**
- [ ] Test with minimum input (edge case)
- [ ] Test with typical input
- [ ] Test with maximum input (stress test)
- [ ] Verify quality gate pass/fail logic
- [ ] Check feedback loop behavior

**For template changes:**
- [ ] Test with each content type
- [ ] Verify word count calculations
- [ ] Check readability targets
- [ ] Ensure citation requirements work

**For config changes:**
- [ ] Test with default values
- [ ] Test with industry overrides
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
- [ ] Check edge cases (extreme values)

### Integration Testing

**Full pipeline test:**
```bash
# Create test requirement in Google Sheets
# Run full pipeline
/contentforge "Generate content for test row in [Sheet URL]"

# Verify:
# - All 10 phases complete
# - Quality score calculated correctly
# - Output .docx generated
# - Tracking sheet updated

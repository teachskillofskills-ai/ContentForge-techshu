## 2. Installation Tests

### 2.1 Marketplace Installation

**Steps:**
1. In Claude Cowork, go to Settings > Plugins > Add Marketplace
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace.git`
3. Install `contentforge`

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Marketplace loads without errors
- [ ] ContentForge listed with the version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] Description mentions "13 agents, 22 skills, 10 industry knowledge packs"
- [ ] Installation completes without rollback
- [ ] No "Host key verification failed" error (uses HTTPS, not SSH)

**If installation fails:**
- Check `~/.claude/logs/main.log` for `VMCLIRunner` errors
- Look for `virtiofs mount: Plan9 mount failed` (VM instability — retry)
- Look for `EXDEV` errors (known bug #25444)
- Clear `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` and retry

### 2.2 Direct URL Installation

**Steps:**
1. Settings > Plugins > Add Plugin
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu.git`

**Expected:** Same results as marketplace installation

### 2.3 Post-Install Verification

ContentForge ships **zero active hooks** (since v3.9.0), so nothing runs and no banner
appears when a session starts. That silence is the correct result — verify the install
explicitly instead.

**Test:** Run `/contentforge:cf-help` in a new session.

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Nothing ran automatically on session start (no banner, no script output)
- [ ] `cf-help` prints live version, agent, skill and command counts read off disk
- [ ] Version shown matches `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] 9 commands visible in Customize panel (create-content, content-brief, social-adapt, publish, translate, brand-setup, audit-content, resume, output-folder)
- [ ] 22 skills visible in Skills section
- [ ] 13 agents registered (check for no frontmatter errors in logs)

For a raw report to paste into a bug ticket:

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin-metadata.py --section all-with-environment --format text
```

### 2.4 Plugin Structure Verification

**Test:** Verify all expected files are present after installation

**Expected file counts:**
- [ ] `agents/` — 13 files (01 through 11 + 03.5 + 06.5)
- [ ] `commands/` — 9 files
- [ ] `skills/` — 22 skill directories, each with SKILL.md
- [ ] `scripts/` — 18 Python files (no `setup.py`; it was removed with the hooks in v3.9.0)
- [ ] `config/` — 7 config files + `industries/` subdirectory with 10 JSON packs
- [ ] `templates/` — 14 template files
- [ ] `utilities/` — 6 utility files
- [ ] `.mcp.json` — ships **empty** on purpose (zero auto-connecting servers); the opt-in catalog is `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`
- [ ] `hooks/hooks.json` — `"hooks": {}` (zero active hooks by design)

---

## 3. Pipeline Tests

The 10-phase pipeline is the core product. Test with different content types and industries.

### 3.1 Full Pipeline — Blog Post (Technology)

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write a blog post about "How AI Agents Are Transforming Content Marketing in 2026" for a technology brand`

**Expected Results — Phase by Phase:**

| Phase | What to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| **Phase 1: Research** | Finds 5+ live sources, competitor analysis, differentiation angle. Research brief output visible. |
| **Phase 2: Fact Check** | Verifies claims, checks URLs, flags unverified stats. 80%+ verification rate. Statistics Verification Report produced. |
| **Phase 3: Content Draft** | Loads technology knowledge pack (Step 0.3 SME Calibration). Uses correct terminology depth. Visual placeholders inserted. Draft Metadata includes SME Calibration Summary. |
| **Phase 3.5: Visual Asset Annotator** | Generates charts from Phase 2 data. Creates `<!-- VISUAL: ... -->` markers. Asset manifest written. Visual density 2-4 per 1000 words for blog. |
| **Phase 4: Scientific Validator** | Validates chart data accuracy. Domain-specific validation (Step 5) checks technology terminology. Zero hallucinations. |
| **Phase 5: Structurer** | Optimizes structure, fixes grammar. Preserves visual markers. |
| **Phase 6: SEO/GEO** | Keyword optimization. Produces typed `<!-- INTERNAL-LINK: type=topical|commercial|conversion|authority \| anchor=... \| url=... -->` markers — three independent categories driven by `seo_preferences.internal_linking` (topical) and `seo_preferences.brand_pages` (commercial / conversion / authority). When a URL is unknown but the opportunity exists, marker emits `url=TBD` for human review — agent must NOT silently skip. SEO scorecard output. |
| **Phase 6.5: Humanizer** | Removes AI telltale phrases. Adds natural voice. Preserves visual + link markers. |
| **Phase 7: Reviewer** | Scores all dimensions including Visual Asset Quality and Internal Linking — split into 6a Topical / 6b Commercial / 6c Conversion sub-scores, averaged for the dimension. No "no site structure = full credit (8)" free-pass; agent must produce useful markers (real URLs or placeholders) to earn credit. Overall score 7+. |
| **Phase 8: Output** | .docx generated. Charts embedded. TODO boxes for human-needed visuals. Internal links as clickable hyperlinks color-coded by category (topical blue, commercial green, conversion purple, authority slate); placeholders render as bold red `[anchor] [LINK TBD: type]`. Appendix D — Internal Link Map shows every link the SEO agent placed with target URLs, anchor text, section, and reason. Completion summary shows internal_links_total and internal_links_by_type. |

**v3.4.0 Feature Checks:**
- [ ] SME Calibration Summary appears in Draft Metadata (Phase 3)
- [ ] Technology knowledge pack loaded (verify terminology like "AI vs ML vs deep learning" distinction)
- [ ] Domain-Specific Validation report section appears in Phase 4 output
- [ ] Visual placeholders marked by Phase 3, annotated by Phase 3.5
- [ ] Phase 4 validates chart data against Phase 2 verified statistics
- [ ] Final output has charts embedded (if data available) or TODO boxes
- [ ] Internal link markers present (or generic recommendations if no site structure)

### 3.2 Full Pipeline — Whitepaper (Pharma)

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write a whitepaper about "The Role of AI in Drug Discovery: From Target Identification to Clinical Trials" for a pharma company`

**Why this test matters:** Pharma is a heavily regulated industry with strict evidence standards.

**Specific Checks:**
- [ ] SME Calibration loads pharma knowledge pack
- [ ] Expertise stance: "Clinical researcher or pharmaceutical scientist"
- [ ] Uses FDA/EMA terminology correctly
- [ ] Evidence hierarchy: Clinical trials ranked above observational studies
- [ ] Required disclaimers present (investigational compound, not medical advice)
- [ ] Domain validation catches prohibited claims ("cure", "miracle", "100% effective")
- [ ] Visual density 3-5 per 1000 words (whitepaper target)
- [ ] Quality Gate 4 includes regulatory compliance check
- [ ] Word count 3000-6000 (whitepaper range)

### 3.3 Full Pipeline — Article (BFSI)

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write an article about "Open Banking APIs: How Financial Institutions Can Monetize Data Safely" for a banking audience`

**Specific Checks:**
- [ ] BFSI knowledge pack loaded
- [ ] Regulatory awareness: GDPR, PCI DSS, SOX mentioned correctly
- [ ] Financial terminology used precisely (APR vs interest rate, etc.)
- [ ] Required disclaimers (not financial advice, regulatory specifics by jurisdiction)
- [ ] Common pitfalls avoided (no "guaranteed returns", no "risk-free")
- [ ] Evidence standards: regulatory filings and official reports cited

### 3.4 Full Pipeline — FAQ (Healthcare)

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write an FAQ about "Understanding Telehealth: Patient Questions Answered" for a healthcare provider`

**Specific Checks:**
- [ ] Healthcare knowledge pack loaded
- [ ] HIPAA awareness in content
- [ ] Medical terminology appropriate for patient audience (simpler language)
- [ ] Disclaimers present (not a substitute for professional medical advice)
- [ ] Visual density 0-1 per 1000 words (FAQ target — minimal visuals)

### 3.5 Full Pipeline — Research Paper (Education)

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write a research paper about "The Impact of AI Tutoring Systems on Student Learning Outcomes" for education researchers`

**Specific Checks:**
- [ ] Education knowledge pack loaded
- [ ] Academic structure: methodology, findings, discussion
- [ ] Evidence standards: peer-reviewed educational research cited
- [ ] FERPA awareness
- [ ] Citation density meets research paper requirements

### 3.6 Pipeline with No Brand Profile

**Prompt:** `/contentforge Write a blog post about "Remote Work Productivity Tips"`

**Without setting up a brand first.**

**Expected:** Pipeline should still work with generic defaults. No crash. Should offer to set up a brand profile.

### 3.7 Pipeline Feedback Loops

**Test:** Trigger a quality gate failure to see if the feedback loop works.

**How:** Request content with an intentionally complex or niche topic that might fail fact-checking. Observe whether Phase 4 → Phase 3.5 feedback loop triggers (max 1 iteration per `scoring-thresholds.json`).

**Expected:**
- [ ] Quality gate failure detected
- [ ] Feedback sent to earlier phase
- [ ] Re-run produces improved output
- [ ] Max loop limit respected (5 total loops, 1 for phase 4→3.5)

| `get-pending` | List pending content | Returns rows with pending status, sorted by priority |
| `get-row` | Get specific row | Returns correct row data |
| `update-row` | Update status | Row updated, no data loss |
| `mark-complete` | Complete a request | Status changed, completion date set |

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] requirement_id uses max existing ID (not row count) — handles deleted rows correctly
- [ ] Priority clamped to 1-5 range
- [ ] Crash-safe sort in get_pending()
- [ ] Auto-installs gspread + google-auth on first run in Cowork VM

### 6.4 drive-uploader.py (requires Google credentials)

- [ ] Output files organized in `outputs/{year}/{month}/` structure
- [ ] Works immediately with no setup
- [ ] Handles concurrent access gracefully

### 6.8 backend-migrator.py

**Test each action:**

| Action | Test | Expected |
|--------|------|----------|

- [ ] Reports migration progress and summary

---

## 7. Config & Industry Knowledge Pack Tests

### 7.1 Validate All 10 Industry Knowledge Packs

For each pack, create a short blog post and verify SME Calibration + Domain Validation:

| Industry | File | Key Terminology to Check |
|----------|------|------------------------|
| technology | `technology.json` | AI vs ML distinction, latency vs throughput, open source definitions |
| pharma | `pharma.json` | Phase I/II/III trials, NDA/BLA, p-values, FDA/EMA protocols |
| bfsi | `bfsi.json` | APR vs interest rate, fiduciary duty, Basel III, KYC/AML |
| healthcare | `healthcare.json` | ICD codes, HIPAA, evidence-based vs experimental |
| real_estate | `real_estate.json` | Cap rate, NOI, fair housing, appraisal vs assessment |
| b2b_saas | `b2b_saas.json` | ARR vs MRR, churn rate, CAC:LTV, net revenue retention |
| legal | `legal.json` | Precedent, statute of limitations, jurisdiction, discovery |
| ecommerce | `ecommerce.json` | AOV, conversion rate, cart abandonment, fulfillment |
| consumer_goods | `consumer_goods.json` | FMCG, SKU rationalization, shelf life, brand equity |
| education | `education.json` | Pedagogy, assessment types, FERPA, accreditation |

**For each pack verify:**
- [ ] SME Calibration Summary references the correct knowledge pack
- [ ] Terminology depth matches the audience level
- [ ] Regulatory awareness matches the industry
- [ ] Evidence standards are applied correctly
- [ ] Domain-specific validation catches industry-specific pitfalls

### 7.2 Scoring Thresholds

Verify `config/scoring-thresholds.json`:
- [ ] `phase_3_5_visual_assets` quality gate present (require_data_chart_verification, min_visual_density, require_alt_text, require_captions)
- [ ] `phase_4_to_3_5` feedback loop limit = 1
- [ ] Regulated industries (pharma, bfsi, healthcare, legal) use stricter thresholds
- [ ] Higher minimum citation accuracy for regulated content
- [ ] Max 5 total feedback loops

### 7.3 Brand Registry Template

Verify `config/brand-registry-template.json`:
- [ ] `industry` field accepts all 10 knowledge pack names
- [ ] `seo_preferences.internal_linking` has `sitemap_url`, `page_registry`, `pillar_pages`
- [ ] `seo_preferences.brand_pages` has `product_or_service_pages`, `conversion_pages`, `authority_pages` (v3.9.5+ — drives commercial / conversion / authority internal links)
- [ ] `google_integration` section present (`credentials_path`, `tracking_sheet_id`, `drive_output_folder_id`)
- [ ] `output_preferences.brand_colors` available for chart styling

### 7.4 Other Config Files

| Config File | Test |
|-------------|------|
| `social-platform-specs.json` | Verify character limits match current platform specs |
| `multilingual-patterns.json` | Verify language codes and brand voice patterns |
| `scoring-thresholds.json` (`default.word_counts`) | Verify word count ranges per content type |

---

## 8. Hook Tests

> **What changed in v3.9.0:** ContentForge ships **no active hooks**. Earlier versions registered
> SessionStart, PreToolUse, SubagentStart and Stop hooks that fired on *every* Claude Code operation
> in *every* project, including unrelated ones. That work now lives where it belongs — hallucination
> and citation checks in the Phase 2.5 scientific-validator and Phase 7 reviewer, brand-voice rules
> in the agent files, and pass/fail thresholds in the Quality Gate criteria.
>
> These tests therefore verify that nothing fires globally, which is the intended behaviour.

### 8.1 No global hooks are registered

**Test:** Install the plugin, then work in an unrelated project (not content production).

**Expected:**
- [ ] `hooks/hooks.json` contains an empty `"hooks": {}` object
- [ ] No ContentForge output appears on session start
- [ ] Nothing from ContentForge runs on Write/Edit in an unrelated repo
- [ ] No added latency or token cost outside ContentForge workflows

### 8.2 The prior hook set is documented, not active

**Test:** Read `hooks/hooks-reference.example.json`.

**Expected:**
- [ ] Documents the pre-v3.9.0 hooks with a rationale note for each
- [ ] Is **not** loaded by the plugin — copying an entry into `hooks/hooks.json` is an explicit opt-in
- [ ] Re-enabling one entry does not re-enable the others

### 8.3 Hallucination detection still happens — inside the pipeline

The checks the old PreToolUse hook performed now run where they can see the verified research
ledger, so test them through a pipeline run rather than at the tool boundary.

| Bad content in the draft | Caught by | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| "Studies show 87% of companies..." (no source) | Phase 2.5 scientific-validator | Flagged — claim absent from the verified ledger |
| "Visit https://example.com/dashboard" | Phase 7 reviewer, Gate 7 | Hard FAIL — dead or placeholder URL |
| "The #1 leading solution in the market" | Phase 7 reviewer | Flagged — unsubstantiated superlative |

**Additional checks:**
- [ ] Legitimate cited statistics pass through without flags
- [ ] Each flag names the phase and gate that raised it

---

## 9. MCP Connector Tests

### 9.1 ContentForge HTTP Connectors (7)

| # | Connector | URL | Test Action | Expected |
|---|-----------|-----|------------|----------|
| 1 | **Notion** | `mcp.notion.com/mcp` | Read a Notion page | Content retrieved via MCP |
| 2 | **Canva** | `mcp.canva.com/mcp` | Generate a design | Design created or template listed |
| 3 | **Figma** | `mcp.figma.com/mcp` | Access design file | Design data retrieved |
| 4 | **Webflow** | `mcp.webflow.com/sse` | Publish draft content | Content appears in Webflow CMS |
| 5 | **Slack** | `mcp.slack.com/mcp` | Send notification | Message delivered to channel |
| 6 | **Gmail** | `gmailmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1` | Draft email | Email draft created |
| 7 | **Google Calendar** | `calendarmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1` | Create content calendar event | Calendar event created |

**Note:** Each connector requires OAuth authorization on first use. The Claude platform handles this — you'll see an authorization prompt. Not all testers will have accounts for all services.

### 9.2 Connector Categories

Verify connectors map to the right workflow categories per CONNECTORS.md:

| Category | Connector | Workflow Impact |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Knowledge base | Notion | Core requirement storage |
| Design | Canva, Figma | Featured images, social graphics |

### 9.3 Graceful Degradation

**Test:** Invoke a skill that uses a connector that's NOT authorized/connected

**Expected:**
- [ ] Skill doesn't crash
- [ ] Clear message about which connector is needed
- [ ] Instructions on how to connect it (or suggestion to run `/contentforge:cf-connect <name>`)
- [ ] Fallback behavior (manual data input or skip)

### 9.4 Platform-Level Integrations

**Test:** Verify Google Drive/Docs work through Claude platform integration (Settings > Integrations)

**Expected:**
- [ ] Google Drive documents accessible for brand knowledge
- [ ] `/contentforge:cf-integrations` notes that platform-level integrations exist separately
- [ ] connector-status.py can't detect platform integrations (expected — mentions this)

## 10. Google Integration Tests

**Prerequisites:** Google service account with Sheets API + Drive API enabled

### 10.1 Initial Setup

1. Create service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Download JSON credentials
3. Place at `~/.claude-marketing/google-credentials.json`
4. Create a Google Sheet and share with service account email
5. Create a Google Drive folder and share with service account email
6. Configure brand profile with `tracking_sheet_id` and `drive_output_folder_id`

### 10.2 Sheets Tracking (End-to-End)

**Test:** Run a full content pipeline and verify tracking

- [ ] Content request added to sheet on pipeline start (`add-row`)
- [ ] Status updates as pipeline progresses (`update-row`)
- [ ] Completion marked when finished (`mark-complete`)
- [ ] requirement_id auto-increments correctly
- [ ] Multiple rows don't collide on IDs after deletions

### 10.3 Drive Delivery (End-to-End)

**Test:** Complete a content piece and verify Drive upload

- [ ] Folder hierarchy created: `Brand/Blog/2026/03/`
- [ ] .docx file uploaded to correct folder
- [ ] Chart assets uploaded to assets subfolder
- [ ] File metadata correct (name, MIME type)

### 10.4 Without Google Credentials

**Test:** Run the full pipeline without Google credentials configured

**Expected:**
- [ ] Pipeline completes normally — no crash
- [ ] Graceful message about Google integration not configured
- [ ] Content saved locally to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/`
- [ ] No error loops or retries

---

## 11. Multi-Backend Tests

### 11.1 Backend Selection During Brand Setup

**Test:** Run `/brand-setup` or `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` and reach Step G

**Expected:**
- [ ] Three options presented: Google Sheets + Drive, Airtable, Local
- [ ] Google and Airtable are primary options (presented first)
- [ ] Local available but only if explicitly chosen or skipped
- [ ] Skipping defaults to local with a message about `/contentforge:cf-switch-backend`
- [ ] Choosing Google triggers service account setup guidance
- [ ] Choosing Airtable triggers token creation guidance
- [ ] Brand profile `tracking.backend` field is set correctly

### 11.2 Pipeline with Each Backend

**Test:** Run a full pipeline with each backend configured

| Backend | What to Verify |
|---------|---------------|
| **Local** | tracking.json updated, .docx in organized outputs/ directory |
| **Airtable** | Airtable record created/updated, .docx attached as attachment |
| **Google** | Sheet row created/updated, .docx uploaded to Drive folder |

### 11.3 Backend Switching

**Test:** `/contentforge:cf-switch-backend airtable` (while currently on local)

**Expected:**
- [ ] Current backend identified and record count shown
- [ ] Target backend validated (AIRTABLE_TOKEN check)
- [ ] Migration offered (yes/no/skip)
- [ ] If "yes": records migrated, files attached, summary shown
- [ ] Brand profile updated to new backend
- [ ] Source data preserved (never deleted)

### 11.4 Backend Migration

**Test:** Migrate from local to Airtable with existing tracking data

**Expected:**
- [ ] All records copied to Airtable
- [ ] Output files attached to Airtable records
- [ ] Migration is idempotent (re-running doesn't create duplicates)
- [ ] Summary shows records_migrated, files_migrated, files_failed counts
- [ ] Source local data remains intact at `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/tracking/`

### 11.5 Pipeline Performance Tracking

**Test:** Run a full pipeline and check the completion summary

**Expected:**
- [ ] PIPELINE PERFORMANCE section has actual times (not placeholder estimates)
- [ ] Per-phase timing table with: Phase, Name, Time, Benchmark, Status, Iterations
- [ ] Phases with feedback loops show correct iteration count
- [ ] Total processing time matches sum of phase times
- [ ] Benchmark comparison shows under/over with correct content type
- [ ] TOKEN USAGE ESTIMATE section present with: Agent Instructions, Content, Config, Subtotal, Overhead, Total
- [ ] Disclaimer: "Token estimates are approximate. For precise session costs, use /cost."

### 11.6 setup.py Backend Detection

**Test:** Start a session with different env vars set

**Expected:**
- [ ] With `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` set: shows "AIRTABLE_TOKEN=configured"
- [ ] Without `AIRTABLE_TOKEN`: shows "AIRTABLE_TOKEN=not_configured"
- [ ] TRACKING_BACKENDS lists all available backends (always includes "local")
- [ ] Google credentials check still works as before

## 12. Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### 11.1 Empty/Minimal Input

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| `/contentforge` (no topic) | Asks for topic, doesn't crash |
| `/brand-setup` (no name) | Asks for brand name |
| `/contentforge:translate` (no language) | Asks for target language |
| `/contentforge:cf-connect` (no service name) | Shows available connectors |
| `/contentforge:cf-help` (no argument) | Shows full help overview |

### 11.2 Very Long Content

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Whitepaper 5000+ words | Pipeline completes, all phases handle length |
| Topic with 50+ research sources | Phase 2 handles gracefully, may take longer |
| Very long brand name (100+ chars) | Paths handled correctly, no truncation issues |

### 11.3 Unsupported Industry

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Brand with industry "aerospace" | Falls back to general defaults (no knowledge pack), warns user |
| Brand with industry "" (empty) | Uses defaults, no crash |
| Brand with misspelled industry "tecnology" | Should suggest "technology" or fall back |

### 11.4 Special Characters in Brand Names

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Apostrophe: "O'Reilly Media" | Drive uploader uses client-side matching (no query injection) |
| Spaces: "Test Brand Alpha" | Paths handled correctly |
| Unicode: "Cafe Express" | No encoding errors |
| Ampersand: "Johnson & Johnson" | No URL encoding issues in Drive/Sheets |

### 11.5 Network Failures

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Run pipeline without internet | Research phase handles gracefully, may ask for manual input |
| MCP connector timeout | Skill shows error, doesn't crash pipeline |
| Google API quota exceeded | Script shows quota error, content saved locally |

### 11.6 Concurrent Operations

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| `/batch-process` with 5 pieces | Queue managed, no interleaving of outputs |
| Start pipeline while another is running | Handled gracefully (queued or error message) |

### 11.7 Pipeline Interruption

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Cancel mid-pipeline (Ctrl+C or close session) | No corrupt data, can restart |
| Reconnect after interruption | Fresh start, no stale state |

## 13. Regression Checklist

Run this after any changes to verify nothing is broken.

### Core Pipeline

- [ ] Session start hook fires with correct version (v3.5)
- [ ] Brand setup completes all steps A-G (including Step G backend selection)
- [ ] Full pipeline runs for blog content type
- [ ] Full pipeline runs for whitepaper content type
- [ ] Phase 3 loads industry knowledge pack (SME Calibration)
- [ ] Phase 3.5 generates visual annotations
- [ ] Phase 4 runs domain-specific validation
- [ ] Phase 6 produces internal link markers
- [ ] Phase 8 embeds charts and link markers in output
- [ ] Hallucination hook catches bad content
- [ ] Hallucination hook skips non-content files

### Skills & Commands

- [ ] All 22 skills respond to invocation
- [ ] All 9 commands appear in Customize panel
- [ ] `/contentforge:cf-help` shows complete, accurate information
- [ ] `/contentforge:cf-integrations` shows 9 HTTP connectors with correct status
- [ ] Argument hints show in Skills UI when typing `/contentforge:` (spot check 3-5 skills)
- [ ] `/contentforge:publish` cannot be triggered by Claude without explicit user invocation (disable-model-invocation)
- [ ] `/contentforge:cf-help` has `name: cf-help` in frontmatter
- [ ] `skills/contentforge/evals/evals.json` exists and is valid JSON with 3 test cases
- [ ] `skills/cf-brief/evals/evals.json` exists and is valid JSON with 2 test cases
- [ ] `skills/cf-style-guide/evals/evals.json` exists and is valid JSON with 2 test cases

### Scripts

- [ ] setup.py runs on session start without errors
- [ ] connector-status.py lists 9 HTTP + script connectors
- [ ] sheets-tracker.py operations work (if Google credentials configured)
- [ ] drive-uploader.py operations work (if Google credentials configured)
- [ ] pipeline-tracker.py init/phase-start/phase-end/get-report all produce valid JSON
- [ ] airtable-tracker.py operations work (if AIRTABLE_TOKEN configured)
- [ ] local-tracker.py operations work (zero deps, no credentials)
- [ ] backend-migrator.py status and migrate actions work

### Versioning Consistency

Never pin version numbers or counts in this checklist — they rot silently (this very
section once pinned v3.8.0 for eleven releases). Verify against the sources of truth:

- [ ] `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version = CHANGELOG.md top entry = README version
      badge (enforced by `tests/test_release_consistency.py`)
- [ ] Root Agent Plugins `plugin.json` carries the same version (enforced by
      `tests/test_agent_plugins_portability.py`)
- [ ] Marketplace entry version matches (checked by the marketplace repo's own suite)
- [ ] Skill / agent / command / script counts in every live doc match the filesystem —
      run `python -m pytest tests/test_doc_counts.py` instead of counting by hand
- [ ] `10-phase pipeline` everywhere (guarded by the same test)
- [ ] AGENTS.md "Supported surfaces" line carries the current version and all 9 native
      surfaces (guarded by the same test)
- [ ] Brand setup mentions Step G (backend selection)

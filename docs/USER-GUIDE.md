# ContentForge — Complete User Guide

> **New in v4.0.0 — the lifecycle release:** ContentForge now closes the loop after publication. `/contentforge:audit-content` records its findings durably (`audits/` per brand, via `scripts/audit-ledger.py`), `/contentforge:cf-calendar --from-audit=latest` and `/contentforge:content-refresh` read those recorded candidates across sessions, `cf-aeo-check` history feeds the freshness model, and each run's verified brand links merge back into `brand_pages` automatically (conversion pages staged for your confirmation, never auto-activated). The pipeline contract is now machine-readable data (`config/pipeline-graph.json`, drift-guarded), and `scripts/telemetry.py` aggregates loop history and humanizer pattern hits across runs — recurring patterns reach the drafter brief as advisories behind a recurrence floor, and never change a gate or a threshold. See the README's "The content lifecycle loop" section.
>
> **New in v3.19.2:** the per-skill `references/` files introduced in v3.19.1 are now covered by a test contract — every "read this before that step" pointer is verified to resolve to a real file and a real heading, no reference file is left uncited, and no content is allowed to live in both a skill body and its own reference. Nothing changes in how you run ContentForge; this keeps a future edit from quietly cutting a skill off from its own examples. See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for the full list.
>
> **New in v3.19.0:** `/contentforge:brand-setup` now auto-harvests your site — a robots-respecting crawler builds your `brand_pages` inventory and pulls verbatim `brand_facts` (one source URL per fact) in a single confirmation step, and the researcher recons your own site first before every piece. The humanizer's detector knowledge is now internalized (43-pattern catalog, a grounding-first rewrite, and an advisory `--ai-tell-scan`) instead of leaning on burstiness tricks. Plus hardened Cowork/sandbox detection. See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for the full list.
>
> **New in v3.18.0:** two more built-in content types — **case study** (client data supplied at intake under a strict provenance rule) and **newsletter** (subject-line package, one-CTA rule) — plus an **author/E-E-A-T byline layer** (add `author_profiles` to your brand profile; `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` prompts for it) and **`/contentforge:cf-aeo-check`**, a post-publication check of whether AI engines actually cite your piece.

**From zero to first published article.** This guide walks you through every step of using ContentForge in Claude Cowork or Claude Code, from initial setup to running the full content production pipeline.

## 1. Before You Start

### What You Need

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Claude Cowork or Claude Code** | Latest version |
| **ContentForge plugin installed** | Via marketplace or manual install |
| **Internet connection** | Required for research phase (web search) |

### What's Optional (But Recommended)

| Optional | What It Unlocks |
|----------|----------------|
| **Google Sheets MCP** | Requirement intake for batch processing, tracking sheets |
| **Google Drive MCP** | Brand knowledge vault, output file storage, .docx uploads |
| **Webflow or WordPress MCP** | Direct CMS publishing via `/contentforge:publish` |
| **Slack MCP** | Pipeline completion notifications |
| **Google Calendar MCP** | Content calendar sync via `/contentforge:cf-calendar` |
| **Notion MCP** | Content brief storage, knowledge base |

**Key point:** ContentForge works fully without any MCP connectors. The core pipeline runs entirely within the Claude session. Connectors add platform integrations but are NOT required.

### How Long Things Take

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| First-time brand setup | 5-10 minutes |
| Single article (1,800 words) | 35-45 minutes |
| Single blog post (1,200 words) | 30-40 minutes |
| Whitepaper (3,500 words) | 45-75 minutes |
| Batch of 10 articles | 3-5 hours (sequential — sum of the individual runs) |
| Social adaptation of 1 article | 3-5 minutes |
| Content brief | 5-8 minutes |

---

## 2. Installation & Verification

### Method A: Claude Marketplace (Recommended)

In Claude Cowork, go to Settings > Plugins > Marketplace and search for "ContentForge" from the `techshu` marketplace.

Or, if using CLI:
```
claude plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace
claude plugin install contentforge@techshu
```

### Method B: Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu.git
```

Move the cloned folder to your Claude plugins directory:
- **Mac/Linux:** `~/.claude/plugins/`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\`

### Verify Installation

ContentForge ships **zero active hooks** by design (since v3.9.0), so there is no startup banner and nothing runs automatically when a session opens. Verify the install explicitly instead:

```
/contentforge:cf-help
```

That prints the user guide plus live version, agent, skill, and command counts read straight off disk.

For a raw report you can paste into a bug ticket, run the metadata script directly:

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin-metadata.py --section all-with-environment --format text
```

It reports the installed version, plugin root, scripts directory, Python version, agent/skill/command counts, and which connectors are currently wired.

**If neither works:**
1. Check the plugin is in the correct directory
2. Check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists and has `"name": "contentforge"`
3. Try reinstalling: clear `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` first

### Check Your Connectors

Run immediately after install:
```
/contentforge:cf-integrations
```

This shows which connectors are active and what they unlock. **Out of the box, zero connectors are active** — `.mcp.json` ships empty on purpose. The opt-in catalog lives in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` (16 HTTP entries: Notion, Canva, Webflow, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Figma, fal.ai, Replicate, plus Pipedream/Composio/Zapier/Make aggregators). Enable the ones you need with `/contentforge:cf-connect`.

---

## 3. Reading the Install Report

`plugin-metadata.py` is the single source of truth for "what's in this install right now" — every count it prints is read from the filesystem, so it never drifts from the shipped plugin:

```
Version: 4.0.0
PLUGIN_ROOT=/home/user/.claude/plugins/contentforge
SCRIPTS_DIR=/home/user/.claude/plugins/contentforge/scripts
Python: 3.10.12
Agents: 13 · Skills: 22 · Commands: 9
Connectors active: 0 (catalog: 16 HTTP, opt-in)
```

This tells you:
- **Version** — Read from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not hardcoded in any doc.
- **PLUGIN_ROOT** — Where the plugin is installed. All scripts reference this path.
- **SCRIPTS_DIR** — Where Python scripts live.
- **Python version** — Must be 3.8+. Cowork VM has 3.10.12.
- **Connectors active** — How many entries are in `.mcp.json` (empty by default).

If you see errors here, check the [Troubleshooting](#21-troubleshooting) section.

---

## 4. Setting Up Your Brand Profile

**This is the most important step.** Brand profiles control voice, tone, terminology, guardrails, citation rules, and quality thresholds for all content. Without a brand profile, ContentForge uses generic defaults.

### Method 1: Guided Setup (Recommended)

The primary route — an interview that walks you through every profile section:

```
/contentforge:brand-setup
```

If you already have brand documents (style guide PDFs, voice guidelines, sample articles, a live brand page), use the import variant instead — it reads your material and extracts the profile for you:

```
/contentforge:cf-style-guide
```

**What happens:**
1. You provide your brand name, industry, and website
2. Optionally share existing documents (style guide PDFs, voice guidelines, sample content)
3. ContentForge extracts: tone, formality, personality traits, terminology, guardrails
4. **Site Harvest (v3.19.0, when you gave a website):** `scripts/harvest-brand-pages.py` crawls it — stdlib, robots-respecting, sitemap-first with a homepage-nav fallback — and returns an HTTP-verified page inventory (service/conversion/authority pages) plus verbatim `brand_facts` with a source URL per fact. You see ONE confirmation screen (page inventory + extracted facts + any inconsistencies between pages) before anything is saved. Decline, and it's recorded honestly rather than silently skipped — declined/no-website/crawl-failed all show up later as a real (never free-passed) reviewer finding if the brand does have a site.
5. Generates a `brand-profile.json` file

**You can provide source material in several ways:**
- **Paste text** directly in the conversation
- **Share a URL** to your brand's style guide or website
- **Upload a document** (if in Claude Code with file access)
- **Reference a Google Drive file** (if Google Drive MCP is connected)

**Example:**
```
/contentforge:cf-style-guide

Brand: AcmeMed
Industry: Healthcare/Pharma
Website: https://acmemed.com

Here's our brand voice guide:
- Tone: Professional, authoritative, data-driven
- We say "patients" not "consumers"
- We say "clinical outcomes" not "results"
- Never make health claims or guarantees
- Always cite peer-reviewed sources
- Reading level: College graduate
```

ContentForge generates a JSON profile that all 13 agents reference during content production.

### Method 2: Manual JSON Creation

Copy the template and fill in your values:

**Source template:** `config/brand-registry-template.json`

**Key sections to fill in:**

```json
{
  "brand_name": "Your Brand Name",
  "industry": "pharma | bfsi | technology | healthcare | legal | education | ecommerce",
  "voice": {
    "tone": "professional | conversational | authoritative | witty",
    "formality": "formal | business_casual | casual",
    "personality_traits": ["helpful", "trustworthy", "data-driven"],
    "writing_style": {
      "sentence_length": "mixed",
      "use_contractions": true,
      "technical_depth": "intermediate"
    }
  },
  "terminology": {
    "preferred_terms": { "customer": "client", "buy": "invest in" },
    "prohibited_terms": ["cheap", "revolutionary", "game-changing"]
  },
  "guardrails": {
    "prohibited_claims": ["Guaranteed results", "No side effects"],
    "required_disclaimers": ["Results may vary."]
  },
  "quality_thresholds": {
    "minimum_quality_score": 7.0,
    "auto_approve_threshold": 8.5
  }
}
```

**Save this file as:** `~/.claude-marketing/brands/YourBrandName-profile.json`

Or, if using Google Drive: save to `ContentForge-Knowledge/YourBrandName/brand-profile.json`

### Method 3: Google Drive Knowledge Vault (Most Comprehensive)

For enterprise brands with extensive guidelines, create a folder structure in Google Drive:

```
Google Drive/
└── ContentForge-Knowledge/
    └── AcmeMed/
        ├── Brand-Guidelines/
        │   ├── voice-and-tone.md          ← Brand voice rules
        │   ├── terminology.md             ← Approved/banned terms
        │   └── visual-identity.pdf        ← Optional, for reference
        ├── Reference-Content/
        │   ├── sample-article-1.md        ← Examples of good content
        │   └── sample-article-2.md        ← More examples
        └── Guardrails/
            ├── prohibited-claims.md       ← What NOT to say
            └── compliance-requirements.md ← Regulatory rules
```

**When ContentForge first runs for this brand:**
1. It reads all files from the Knowledge Vault
2. Processes them into a structured brand profile
3. Calculates a SHA256 hash of all source files
4. Caches the profile locally for fast future access

**On subsequent runs:**
1. Checks the SHA256 hash of source files
2. If unchanged → loads cached profile in <5 seconds
3. If changed → re-processes (2-5 minutes)

**Requirement:** Google Drive MCP must be connected. Run `/contentforge:cf-integrations` to verify.

### What If I Don't Have a Brand Profile?

ContentForge will still work. It will:
- Use generic professional tone
- Apply default quality thresholds (≥7.0 to pass)
- Use standard citation rules (APA format)
- Not enforce any brand-specific terminology

**This is fine for testing** but not recommended for production content.

### How Brand Profiles Are Used

Every agent in the pipeline references the brand profile:

| Agent | What It Uses |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 (Research) | Industry context, competitor URLs, target audience |
| Phase 3 (Drafter) | Voice, tone, terminology, writing style |
| Phase 5 (Structurer) | Formatting preferences, brand compliance rules |
| Phase 6 (SEO) | Keyword preferences, meta tag formats |
| Phase 6.5 (Humanizer) | Personality profile, industry-specific patterns |
| Phase 7 (Reviewer) | Quality thresholds, dimension weights, industry overrides |
| Phase 8 (Output) | File format, header/footer, brand colors |

---

## 5. Setting Up Google Sheets (Optional)

Google Sheets integration enables two things:
1. **Requirement intake** — Define what content to produce in a spreadsheet
2. **Tracking** — ContentForge updates the sheet with quality scores, status, output links

### When Do You Need Google Sheets?

| Scenario | Need Sheets? |
|----------|-------------|
| Running a single piece interactively | No |
| Running batch of 10+ pieces | Recommended |
| Tracking quality scores over time | Recommended |
| Agency managing multiple clients | Strongly recommended |

### Sheet Structure for Content Requirements

Create a Google Sheet with these columns:

| Column | Required? | Description | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| A: Requirement ID | Yes | Unique identifier | REQ-001 |
| B: Content Type | Yes | article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research_paper, video_script, case_study, newsletter | article |
| C: Title/Topic | Yes | What the content is about | "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends" |
| D: Target Audience | Recommended | Who reads this | "Healthcare CIOs" |
| E: Brand | Yes | Brand profile name | AcmeMed |
| F: Primary Keyword | Recommended | Main SEO keyword | "AI healthcare 2026" |
| G: Word Count Target | Optional | Target word count | 1800 |
| H: Priority | Optional | 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest) | 1 |
| I: Tone Override | Optional | Override brand default | conversational |
| J: Status | Auto-filled | pending → in_progress → complete → failed | pending |
| K: Quality Score | Auto-filled | Overall score (1-10) | 9.0 |
| L: Output URL | Auto-filled | Google Drive link to .docx | https://drive.google.com/... |
| M: Processing Time | Auto-filled | Minutes taken | 24 |
| N: Completed At | Auto-filled | Timestamp | 2026-02-25T14:30:00Z |

**Initial setup:**
1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Add headers in Row 1 (columns A through N)
3. Fill in Rows 2+ with your content requirements
4. Set Status column to "pending" for all rows
5. Share the sheet URL with ContentForge

**Example:**
| Req ID | Type | Title | Audience | Brand | Keyword | Words | Priority |
|--------|------|-------|----------|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| REQ-001 | article | AI in Healthcare 2026 | Healthcare CIOs | AcmeMed | AI healthcare 2026 | 1800 | 1 |
| REQ-002 | blog | 10 Remote Team Tips | HR Managers | TechCorp | remote team management | 1200 | 3 |
| REQ-003 | whitepaper | Cloud Security Trends | CISOs | SecureCloud | cloud security 2026 | 3500 | 2 |

### Connecting Google Sheets

**If you see "Google Sheets" as connected in `/contentforge:cf-integrations`:** You're ready. No additional setup needed.

**If not connected:**
```
/contentforge:cf-connect google-sheets
```

This walks you through the setup. Google Sheets uses npx MCP (not HTTP), so you'll need:
1. A Google Cloud Project
2. Service Account with Sheets API enabled
3. Credentials JSON file
4. Add the npx server to `.mcp.json`

See [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md) for detailed instructions.

---

## 6. Setting Up Google Drive Knowledge Vault (Optional)

### When Do You Need Google Drive?

| Scenario | Need Drive? |
|----------|------------|
| Simple content with inline brand description | No |
| Multiple brands with detailed guidelines | Yes |
| Regulated industry (Pharma, BFSI, Legal) | Strongly recommended |
| Content output storage (.docx upload) | Yes |
| Team collaboration on brand profiles | Yes |

### Folder Structure

Create this folder structure in Google Drive:

```
ContentForge-Knowledge/
├── AcmeMed/                          ← One folder per brand
│   ├── Brand-Guidelines/
│   │   ├── voice-and-tone.md         ← Required: Voice, tone, formality
│   │   ├── terminology.md            ← Required: Preferred/banned terms
│   │   └── visual-identity.pdf       ← Optional: Logos, colors (for reference)
│   ├── Reference-Content/
│   │   ├── best-article.md           ← Optional: Example of great content
│   │   └── approved-blog.md          ← Optional: Another example
│   └── Guardrails/
│       ├── prohibited-claims.md      ← Required for regulated: What NOT to say
│       └── compliance-reqs.md        ← Required for regulated: FDA/SEC/HIPAA rules
├── TechCorp/                         ← Second brand
│   ├── Brand-Guidelines/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ContentForge-Output/              ← Auto-created by Output Manager
    ├── AcmeMed/
    │   └── AI-in-Healthcare-2026_v1.0.docx
    └── TechCorp/
        └── Remote-Team-Tips_v1.0.docx
```

### What Goes in Each File

**`voice-and-tone.md`** — The most important file:
```markdown
# AcmeMed Brand Voice

## Tone
Professional, authoritative, data-driven. We are trusted advisors, not salespeople.

## Formality
Business casual. Use contractions (it's, we're) but avoid slang.

## Personality
- Helpful: Always provide actionable takeaways
- Trustworthy: Back every claim with data
- Innovative: Show awareness of cutting-edge developments
- Empathetic: Acknowledge patient/provider challenges

## Writing Style
- Active voice preferred
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences)
- Use questions to engage readers
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it
- Technical depth: Intermediate (explain complex concepts clearly)
```

**`terminology.md`** — Approved and banned terms:
```markdown
# AcmeMed Terminology

## Always Use
| Instead Of | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| customer | patient or healthcare provider |
| product | solution or platform |
| buy | invest in |
| cheap | cost-effective |
| users | clinicians |

## Never Use
- "revolutionary" (overused, unsubstantiated)
- "game-changing" (cliche)
- "cure" (regulatory risk)
- "guarantee" (legal liability)
- "best in class" (unsupported superlative)

## Product Names
- Always: "AcmeMed Platform" (with trademark: AcmeMed Platform™)
- Never: "the Acme system" or "AcmeMed software"
```

**`prohibited-claims.md`** (for regulated industries):
```markdown
# AcmeMed Guardrails

## Prohibited Claims
1. No health outcome guarantees ("will cure", "guaranteed to improve")
2. No unsupported superlatives ("best", "only", "first")
3. No competitor bashing by name
4. No off-label use suggestions
5. No patient testimonials without disclaimer

## Required Disclaimers
- Medical content: "Consult your healthcare provider before making treatment decisions."
- Data content: "Based on available data as of [date]. Results may vary."
- Financial content: "Not financial advice. Consult a qualified advisor."

## Regulatory Framework
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for medical claims
- HIPAA considerations for patient data references
- FTC disclosure requirements for sponsored content
```

### How ContentForge Processes These Documents

1. **On first run for a brand:** ContentForge reads ALL files in the brand's Knowledge Vault folder
2. **Extracts structured data:** Voice → tone/formality/personality, Terminology → preferred/banned terms, Guardrails → prohibited claims/disclaimers
3. **Generates brand profile JSON:** Combines everything into the structured format from `config/brand-registry-template.json`
4. **Caches with SHA256 hash:** Saves the processed profile locally at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/`
5. **Future runs:** Compares file hashes → if unchanged, loads cache in <5 seconds

### Auto-Creation vs Manual

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| **Auto (via Knowledge Vault)** | You have existing brand documents. ContentForge extracts and structures them. |
| **Auto (via `/contentforge:cf-style-guide`)** | You describe your brand verbally or share a URL. ContentForge generates the profile. |
| **Manual (copy template)** | You want full control over every field. Copy `config/brand-registry-template.json` and edit. |

**All three approaches produce the same result:** a structured brand profile JSON that all agents reference.

---

## 7. Running Your First Content Piece

### Simplest Possible Start (No Setup Required)

```
/contentforge "Write a 1500-word article about AI in healthcare for 2026"
```

ContentForge will:
1. Ask which brand to use (or use defaults if none exist)
2. Run a quick SERP scan on your topic keyword
3. Generate **4-5 SEO-optimized title options** (different angles per content type)
4. Wait for you to **select, modify, or provide your own title**
5. Run the 10-phase pipeline using your confirmed title as the anchor
6. Output a quality scorecard + the content

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for First Time)

```
/contentforge
```

You'll be prompted for:
1. **Topic** — The subject area (e.g., "AI in Healthcare") — NOT the final title
2. **Content Type** — Select: article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research_paper, video_script, case_study, newsletter
3. **Brand** — Select from existing profiles (or "default")
4. **Target Audience** — e.g., "Healthcare Executives"
5. **Word Count** — e.g., 1800 (or press Enter for default)
6. **Primary Keyword** — e.g., "AI diagnostics precision medicine"

Then **Title Curation** begins (mandatory before pipeline starts):
- Quick SERP scan of top 5 results for your keyword
- 4-5 title options generated (angles vary by content type)
- Each validated against brand guardrails, 60-char SERP limit, competitor differentiation
- You choose: select a number, modify one, combine elements, or write your own
- Pipeline starts only after you confirm a title

### Full Parameters Mode

```
/contentforge "AI-Powered Diagnostics: The Future of Precision Medicine" --type=article --brand=AcmeMed --audience="Healthcare Executives" --keyword="AI diagnostics precision medicine" --words=1800 --tone=authoritative
```

### From Google Sheet

```
/contentforge --sheet-url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123 --row=5
```

Reads requirement from Row 5 of the sheet.

### What to Expect

After you provide inputs, title curation runs first, then the pipeline:

```
Title Curation — Scanning SERP for "AI diagnostics"...
  1. "AI Diagnostics in Healthcare: What Clinicians Need to Know" (54 chars)
  2. "How AI Is Transforming Medical Diagnostics in 2026" (50 chars)
  3. "5 Ways AI Diagnostics Improve Patient Outcomes" (47 chars)
  4. "AI-Powered Diagnostics: The Future of Precision Medicine" (56 chars)
  5. "Why Top Hospitals Are Betting on AI Diagnostics" (48 chars)
  Which title? (pick, modify, or provide your own) → User selects "4"
✓ Title confirmed

Phase 1: Research Agent — Finding sources for "AI Diagnostics"...
✓ Phase 1 complete — 12 sources found, outline generated
Phase 2: Fact Checker — Verifying 12 sources...
✓ Phase 2 complete — 11 URLs live, 1 flagged for replacement
Phase 3: Content Drafter — Writing first draft...
✓ Phase 3 complete — 1,847 words, 12 citations
Phase 3.5: Visual Asset Annotator — Finding visual opportunities...
✓ Phase 3.5 complete — 2 charts from verified stats, 3 visuals annotated for human action

✓ Phase 4 complete — 0 hallucinations, all claims traceable
Phase 5: Structurer & Proofreader — Polishing grammar and structure...
✓ Phase 5 complete — 0 errors, readability Grade 11.2
Phase 6: SEO/GEO Optimizer — Optimizing for search engines...
✓ Phase 6 complete — Keyword placements 5/5 (title, first 100 words, 2 H2s, conclusion, meta), GEO score 8.5
Phase 6.5: Humanizer — Removing AI patterns...
✓ Phase 6.5 complete — 14 AI patterns removed, AI-detectability (advisory): LOW — 2 signals flagged
Phase 7: Reviewer — Scoring content quality...
✓ Phase 7 complete — Score: 9.0/10 (Grade A) — APPROVED
Phase 8: Output Manager — Generating deliverables...
✓ Phase 8 complete — .docx generated

TOTAL TIME: 24 minutes
```

```

Phase 3.5 (Visual Asset Annotator) turns verified statistics into charts and marks every remaining visual that needs human action. It sits between the draft and the validator so that charts are audited alongside the prose they illustrate.

**Phase 6.5's advisory AI-tell scan (v3.19.0).** After the Human-Expert Grounding Pass and content-derived variety pass, `scripts/text-metrics.py --ai-tell-scan` runs a deterministic, dependency-free proxy scan (aphorism density, banned lexemes, connective/participial-opener rate, uniform sentence runs) and reports a **LOW / MODERATE / HIGH** rating. It's surfaced in the Humanization Report, the Phase 7 Readability sub-score, and the Completion Card — it never blocks publication on its own, and no ContentForge output claims to "beat" any specific external detector. If an external AI-detector is reachable via a connected MCP, at most one optional validation pass may run against it, also advisory.

### Feedback Loops (When Things Fail)

The pipeline doesn't just run forward — it can loop back:

```
Phase 4 (Validator) finds hallucination → Loops to Phase 3 (Drafter) to fix it
Phase 6 (SEO) degrades readability → Loops to Phase 5 (Structurer) to rebalance
Phase 7 (Reviewer) scores <7.0 → Loops to weakest phase with feedback
```

**Loop limits:**
- **Per edge:** Max 2 loops on any single edge (Phase 4 → Phase 3, Phase 6.5 → Phase 6, Phase 7 → the responsible phase)
- Phase 3.5 re-runs for rejected visuals are not a loop edge and don't count against the budget
- **Total:** Max 5 loops across entire pipeline
- **If exceeded:** Escalates to human review (never auto-publishes bad content)

### Three-Layer Fact Verification

This is what makes ContentForge different from single-prompt tools:

| Layer | Phase | What It Checks |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Layer 1 | Phase 2 (Fact Checker) | Are sources real? Are URLs live? Are claims in the source material? |
| Layer 2 | Phase 4 (Scientific Validator) | Did the drafter fabricate any statistics? Are there logical inconsistencies? |
| Layer 3 | Phase 7 (Reviewer) | Final citation integrity audit as part of holistic quality assessment |

**What this buys you:** every statistic, quote, and citation in the finished piece has been traced back to a source that was checked for existence (Layer 1), re-checked against the draft for fabrication or drift (Layer 2), and audited once more for citation integrity during scoring (Layer 3). Claims that fail any layer are removed, re-sourced, or escalated — they never survive to the deliverable. It is a verification chain, not a guarantee: sources can themselves be wrong, and anything a layer flags as unresolved is handed to you rather than silently fixed.

## 9. Reading the Quality Scorecard

After Phase 7, you get a detailed scorecard:

### Overall Score

```
OVERALL SCORE: 9.0 / 10
Decision: ✅ APPROVED
Grade: A
```

**What the scores mean:**

| Score | Grade | Decision |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 9.5-10.0 | A+ | APPROVED — Exceptional, repurpose aggressively |
| 9.0-9.4 | A | APPROVED — Excellent |
| 8.5-8.9 | A- | APPROVED — Very good |
| 8.0-8.4 | B+ | APPROVED — Good |
| 7.5-7.9 | B | APPROVED — Above average |
| 7.0-7.4 | B- | APPROVED — Meets minimum |
| 6.5-6.9 | C+ | LOOP — Below standard, needs fixes |
| 6.0-6.4 | C | LOOP — Significant improvement needed |
| 5.0-5.9 | C-/D | LOOP — Major revisions needed |
| <5.0 | F | HUMAN REVIEW — Cannot auto-fix |

### 5 Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Content Quality** | 30% | Depth, originality, audience value, structure, completeness |
| **Citation Integrity** | 25% | Factual accuracy, source quality, formatting, recency |
| **Brand Compliance** | 20% | Voice, terminology, guardrails, POV consistency |
| **SEO Performance** | 15% | Keywords, meta tags, on-page elements, GEO readiness |
| **Readability** | 10% | Grade level, sentence variety, scannability, humanization |

### Comparative Analysis

If you've produced content for this brand before, the scorecard also shows:

```
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Percentile Ranking: 94th percentile (scores better than 94% of AcmeMed content)
vs. Brand Average: +1.2 above average (9.0 vs 7.8)
```

```

---

## 10. Publishing & Social Adaptation

### Publishing to CMS

```
/contentforge:publish
```

**Supported platforms:**
- **Webflow** (via HTTP MCP) — Direct publishing
- **WordPress** (via npx MCP) — Direct publishing
- **HTML export** (fallback) — Copy HTML to any CMS manually

**What happens:**
1. ContentForge checks if Webflow or WordPress MCP is connected
2. If connected: formats content for the platform, shows preview, publishes on your confirmation
3. If not connected: exports clean HTML + metadata for manual upload

### Social Media Adaptation

```
/contentforge:social-adapt
```

Takes any ContentForge article and generates posts for:

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| **LinkedIn** | Professional post, 1,300 char max, 3-5 hashtags |
| **Twitter/X** | Thread of 3-5 tweets, 280 char each, 2-3 hashtags |
| **Instagram** | Caption with line breaks, 2,200 char max, 20-30 hashtags |
| **Facebook** | Engaging post, 500-1,000 chars, 1-2 hashtags |
| **Threads** | Conversational post, 500 char max, 3-5 hashtags |

**How to use:**
```
/contentforge:social-adapt "AI in Healthcare article we just produced"
```

Or provide the article directly:
```
/contentforge:social-adapt --source="path/to/article.md" --platforms=linkedin,twitter
```

The Social Adapter Agent (#10) identifies 10-15 shareworthy moments from your article (statistics, quotes, frameworks, surprising facts) and builds platform-specific posts around them.

---

## 11. Batch Processing (Multiple Pieces)

### When to Use

When you have 2+ content pieces to produce. `/batch-process` turns them into a prioritized, checkpointed queue and runs them **one at a time** — each piece gets the full 10-phase pipeline and all 10 quality gates. There is no concurrency and no speedup multiplier: batch mode changes the intake and the recovery story, not the standards or the clock. What you gain is that an interrupted batch resumes at the exact piece and phase where it stopped instead of restarting.

### Setup

**Option A: Google Sheet**
1. Create a sheet with the structure from [Section 5](#5-setting-up-google-sheets-optional)
2. Fill in multiple rows
3. Run:
```
/batch-process --sheet-url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123
```

**Option B: CSV**
```csv
requirement_id,content_type,title,target_audience,brand,word_count,priority,status
REQ-001,article,AI in Healthcare 2026,Healthcare CIOs,AcmeMed,2000,1,pending
REQ-002,blog,10 Tips for Remote Teams,HR Managers,TechCorp,1500,3,pending
REQ-003,whitepaper,Cloud Security Trends,CISOs,SecureCloud,3500,2,pending
```

**Option C: Interactive**
```
/batch-process
```
You'll be prompted for: source (sheet/CSV/manual), requirements, processing options.

### What Happens

1. **Queue builds** — All requirements sorted by priority
2. **Sequential execution** — One pipeline at a time, in queue order; every phase of every piece is checkpointed to disk
3. **Progress tracking** — Dashboard showing the in-flight piece's phase, plus completed/queued counts
4. **Resume on interruption** — Completed pieces are skipped; the in-flight piece restarts from its last gate-passed phase
5. **Completion report** — Summary of all pieces with scores, times, links

### Completion Report

```
BATCH COMPLETE: 10 of 10 pieces

Results:
| Req ID | Title | Score | Grade | Time | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| REQ-001 | AI in Healthcare | 9.0 | A | 24m | ✅ Published |
| REQ-002 | Remote Team Tips | 8.3 | B+ | 18m | ✅ Published |
| REQ-003 | Cloud Security | 8.7 | A- | 38m | ✅ Published |
...

Summary:
- Average Score: 8.6/10
- Total Time: 240 minutes (sum of the 10 runs — pieces run one at a time)
- Resumed after interruption: 1 piece (REQ-007, from Phase 5)
- Failures: 0
- Human Review: 0
```

---

## 12. Content Refresh (Updating Old Content)

### When to Use

- Content is 6+ months old
- Search rankings are declining
- Statistics are outdated
- Competitor content has surpassed yours

### How to Use

```
/content-refresh "https://docs.google.com/document/d/XYZ123"
```

Or with local file:
```
/content-refresh --file="path/to/old-article.docx"
```

### Refresh Levels

| Level | What Changes | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Light (20%)** | Update statistics and citations only | 10-15 min |
| **Medium (50%)** | Rewrite intro/conclusion + update 3-5 sections | 15-25 min |
| **Heavy (80%)** | Near-complete rewrite using original as outline | 25-40 min |

### Version Control

Content Refresh NEVER overwrites the original. It saves as:
- Original: `AI-in-Healthcare_v1.0.docx`
- After refresh: `AI-in-Healthcare_v1.1.docx`

---

## 13. Content Briefs & Planning

### Creating a Brief

```
/contentforge:cf-brief "AI diagnostics in healthcare"
```

**Output includes:**
- Keyword research (primary + secondary keywords, search volume, difficulty)
- Competitor analysis (top 5 SERP results, their angles, content gaps)
- Search intent analysis (informational, commercial, transactional)
- Audience pain points and questions
- Recommended outline with H2/H3 structure
- SEO strategy (target density, featured snippet opportunities)
- Suggested word count and content type

**Briefs feed into the pipeline:** You can pass a brief directly to `/contentforge`:
```
/contentforge --brief="the brief we just generated" --brand=AcmeMed
```

---

## 14. A/B Variants & Testing

### Generating Variants

```
/contentforge:cf-variants "headline for the AI Healthcare article"
```

**Generates 3-10 variations** of:
- Headlines/titles
- Opening hooks
- CTAs (calls to action)

Each variant is scored on: clarity, emotional appeal, specificity, curiosity, keyword presence, and brand voice alignment.

**Example output:**
```
HEADLINE VARIANTS

1. "AI Diagnostics Cut Misdiagnosis Rates by 47% — Here's How" (Score: 9.2)
   Clarity: 9 | Emotion: 8 | Specificity: 10 | Curiosity: 9

2. "The Future of Precision Medicine Is Already Here" (Score: 7.8)
   Clarity: 8 | Emotion: 9 | Specificity: 5 | Curiosity: 8

3. "Why Every Hospital Will Use AI Diagnostics by 2028" (Score: 8.5)
   Clarity: 9 | Emotion: 7 | Specificity: 8 | Curiosity: 9
```

---

## 15. Translation & Multilingual Content

### Translating Content

```
/contentforge:translate --content="the article we just produced" --language=es --level=adapted
```

### Three Localization Levels

| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Literal** | Word-for-word translation, minimal adaptation | Technical docs, legal content |
| **Adapted** | Natural language + cultural references adjusted | Blog posts, articles |
| **Transcreated** | Complete re-creation for target culture | Marketing campaigns, social content |

### Supported Languages

15+ languages including Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Hindi, Arabic, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Turkish, Polish, Thai.

### How It Works

The Translator Agent (#11):
1. **Classifies elements** — What's translatable vs. what should stay (brand names, product names, URLs)
2. **Maps brand voice** — Translates tone characteristics to target language conventions
3. **Cultural adaptation** — Adjusts idioms, metaphors, cultural references
4. **SEO adaptation** — Researches equivalent keywords in target language
5. **Quality check** — Verifies brand voice preserved, no meaning drift

---

## 16. Video Scripts

### Generating a Video Script

```
/contentforge:cf-video-script --source="the article we produced" --platform=youtube --duration=5min
```

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Duration Range | Format |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| YouTube | 3-10 minutes | Full script with B-roll notes |
| TikTok | 30-60 seconds | Hook-heavy, visual-first |
| Instagram Reels | 30-90 seconds | Visual hooks, trending audio |
| Explainer | 2-5 minutes | Educational, step-by-step |

### Output Format

```
[0:00-0:15] HOOK
Dialogue: "47% fewer misdiagnoses. That's not a prediction — it's happening right now."
Visual: B-roll of medical professional reviewing AI scan
Music: Upbeat, modern

[0:15-0:45] CONTEXT
Dialogue: "In 2026, hospitals using AI diagnostic tools are seeing..."
Visual: Data visualization animation
B-roll: Hospital technology room
...
```

---

## 17. Content Audits & Calendar

### Content Audit

```
/contentforge:cf-audit
```

**What it does:**
- Scans your content library for content decay (declining freshness)
- Scores each piece 0-100 on freshness
- Identifies coverage gaps (topics competitors cover that you don't)
- Recommends top 10 pieces for refresh
- Identifies topics for new content

### Content Calendar

```
/contentforge:cf-calendar
```

**What it does:**
- Plans content production schedule
- Works backward from publish dates
- Detects deadline conflicts
- Syncs with Google Calendar (if connected via MCP)
- Tracks production status per piece

---

## 18. Style Guides & Custom Templates

### Creating a Style Guide

```
/contentforge:cf-style-guide
```

See [Section 4](#4-setting-up-your-brand-profile) for full details. This skill creates brand profiles from natural language descriptions, URLs, or existing documents.

### Creating Custom Templates

ContentForge ships with 5 content type templates: Article, Blog, Whitepaper, FAQ, Research Paper.

Need a different type? Create it:

```
/contentforge:cf-template "case study"
```

**Define:**
- Structure (sections, headers, flow)
- Quality standards (specific to this type)
- Word count range
- Readability target
- Citation minimum
- Any special requirements

The new template is saved and available for all future `/contentforge` and `/batch-process` runs.

---

## 19. Analytics & Quality Tracking

### Viewing Analytics

```
/contentforge:cf-analytics
```

**Shows:**
- Quality score trends over time (improving, stable, declining)
- Phase timing breakdown (which phases take longest)
- Brand performance comparison (if managing multiple brands)
- Dimension trend analysis (which dimensions are consistent vs. volatile)
- Production velocity (pieces per week/month)

**Data sources:**
- **Google Sheets** (recommended) — Reads from tracking sheet
- **Local** — Falls back to a per-brand JSON tracking file at `~/.claude-marketing/{brand-slug}/tracking/tracking.json` (managed by `scripts/local-tracker.py`; no setup, no auth)

---

## 20. Connector Management

### Checking Connector Status

```
/contentforge:cf-integrations
```

**Shows a dashboard:**
```

```

### Setting Up a Connector

```
/contentforge:cf-connect google-sheets
```

**For HTTP connectors (Notion, Slack, etc.):**
1. Click the OAuth link
2. Authorize in your browser
3. Done — connector is active

**For npx connectors (Google Sheets, Google Drive, WordPress, etc.):**
1. Set up required credentials (API keys, service accounts)
2. Add environment variables to `.env`
3. Add the npx server config to `.mcp.json`
4. Restart Claude session

`/contentforge:cf-connect` walks you through every step with copy-paste commands.

---

## 21. Troubleshooting

### Plugin Doesn't Load

**Symptom:** `/contentforge:cf-help` isn't recognized and no ContentForge skills appear.

Note that silence at session start is **normal** — ContentForge ships zero active hooks, so it prints nothing until you invoke a skill.

**Fixes:**
1. Verify plugin is in `~/.claude/plugins/contentforge/`
2. Check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists and has `"name": "contentforge"`
3. Run `claude plugin validate ~/.claude/plugins/contentforge`
4. Clear plugin cache: delete `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` and reinstall

### "Brand profile not found"

**Symptom:** Pipeline asks for brand but can't find your profile.

**Fixes:**
1. Create a profile: `/contentforge:cf-style-guide`
2. Or use default: run without specifying `--brand`
3. If using Knowledge Vault: verify Google Drive MCP is connected

### Pipeline Stuck in Loops

**Symptom:** Content keeps looping between phases, never approving.

**Fixes:**
1. Check the quality scorecard — which dimension is failing?
2. Run `/contentforge:cf-brief` — a better brief leads to better content
3. Run `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` — ensure brand profile is complete
4. Lower thresholds temporarily: edit `config/scoring-thresholds.json`
5. Check topic — very niche topics may lack sufficient sources

### Humanizer Degrades SEO

**Symptom:** SEO score drops after Phase 6.5.

**Expected behavior:** The pipeline auto-detects this and loops Phase 6.5 → Phase 6 for re-optimization. Usually resolves on second pass.

### Connector Not Working

**Symptom:** Skill says connector unavailable.

**Fixes:**
1. Run `/contentforge:cf-integrations` to check status
2. Run `/contentforge:cf-connect <name>` for setup guide
3. Verify `.mcp.json` has the connector entry
4. For npx: check environment variables are set

### Quality Scores Consistently Low

**Symptom:** Pieces scoring 5.0-6.5 regularly.

**Root causes and fixes:**
- **Weak briefs** → Run `/contentforge:cf-brief` before `/contentforge`
- **Incomplete brand profile** → Run `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` to enhance it
- **Complex topics** → ContentForge needs good source material; try broader topics first
- **Restrictive guardrails** → Review brand profile guardrails, ensure they're not overly limiting

## Appendix A: Complete Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Agency producing 5 articles for healthcare client "AcmeMed"

### Step 1: Brand Setup (One-Time, 10 min)
```
/contentforge:cf-style-guide
```
Provide AcmeMed's brand guidelines. ContentForge generates the profile.

### Step 2: Content Briefs (10 min)
```
/contentforge:cf-brief "AI diagnostics in healthcare 2026"
/contentforge:cf-brief "patient data privacy regulations 2026"
/contentforge:cf-brief "telemedicine ROI for hospitals"
/contentforge:cf-brief "healthcare AI implementation roadmap"
/contentforge:cf-brief "clinical trial automation with AI"
```

### Step 3: Set Up Requirements Sheet (5 min)
Create Google Sheet with 5 rows using briefs from Step 2.

### Step 4: Batch Production (2-2.5 hours)
```
/batch-process --sheet-url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123
```
The queue runs the 5 articles one at a time, checkpointing every phase. If the session drops, re-run the same command — finished pieces are skipped and the in-flight piece resumes from its last gate-passed phase.

### Step 5: Review Scorecards
All 5 articles scored ≥7.0 → APPROVED.

### Step 6: Social Adaptation (15 min)
```
/contentforge:social-adapt --source="all 5 articles" --platforms=linkedin,twitter
```

### Step 7: Publish (5 min)
```
/contentforge:publish --platform=webflow
```

### Step 8: Track (Ongoing)
```
/contentforge:cf-analytics
```

**Total time:** ~3 hours for 5 publication-ready articles + social posts + CMS publishing.

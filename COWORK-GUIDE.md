## What is ContentForge?

ContentForge is an **enterprise-grade content production system** that transforms a simple content brief into publication-ready, fact-checked, brand-compliant content.

**Realistic timing per piece:** FAQ 30-35 min · article 35-45 min · whitepaper 45-75 min · research paper 60-90 min.

### What Makes It Different

Unlike single-prompt tools (ChatGPT, Gemini), ContentForge runs your content through **10 specialized quality gates**:

✅ **Three-Layer Fact Verification** — Phases 2, 4, and 7 each re-check claims against the verified source ledger. Production runs typically achieve high factual accuracy — verify every claim before publishing.
✅ **95%+ Citation Accuracy** — All claims traceable to verified sources
✅ **Brand Voice Consistency** — Automatically applies your brand guidelines
✅ **Natural Language** — Phase 6.5 Humanizer removes AI writing patterns
✅ **SEO Optimized** — Keyword targeting, meta tags, readability scoring
✅ **Human Oversight** — Content <5.0/10 escalates to review, never auto-publishes

### Who Should Use This

- **Digital marketing agencies** managing 50-200 brands
- **In-house content teams** with high volume (20-50+ pieces/month)
- **Regulated industries** (Pharma, BFSI, Healthcare, Legal) requiring fact-checking
- **SEO teams** needing research-backed, cited content at scale
- **Enterprise brands** requiring consistent quality across teams

## Installation in Cowork

### Step 1: Open Cowork
Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and log in to your Cowork workspace.

> **Important:** the `/plugin` slash command does **not** exist in Cowork — it is Claude Code CLI/IDE only. In Cowork you install and manage plugins from the **Plugins panel**. Once ContentForge is installed, its skills (`/contentforge:*`) work normally in Cowork chat; only the `/plugin` *management* commands are unavailable.

### Step 2: Open the Plugins Panel
In the Cowork sidebar, click **Plugins** (or go to **Settings → Plugins**).

### Step 3: Add the Marketplace
Click **Add marketplace** and enter:
```
teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace
```

The marketplace appears in the list with its available plugins.

### Step 4: Install ContentForge
Find **contentforge** in the marketplace listing and click **Install**.

The panel shows the installed version — **ContentForge v3.16.1**.

### Step 5: Verify Installation
Back in Cowork chat, type `/` and start typing `contentforge`. The skill list should autocomplete with:
```
/contentforge:create-content   — Run the full 10-phase pipeline on one piece
/contentforge:batch-process    — Work through a queue of pieces, one at a time
/contentforge:content-refresh  — Update old content
/contentforge:cf-variants      — Generate A/B variations of headlines, hooks, CTAs
/contentforge:cf-analytics     — Quality score trends and brand performance
/contentforge:publish          — Publish to Webflow/WordPress, or export HTML
  ... (22 skills total)
```

**✅ Installation Complete!** Now set up your integrations.

## MCP Integration Setup

ContentForge does **not** require Google Sheets or Google Drive. Local tracking is the zero-config default: brand profiles, run records, and finished `.docx` files are written to the filesystem with no integration set up at all.

Drive is **optional**, and its main job is Cowork team persistence — the Cowork sandbox filesystem disappears at session end, so a team that wants outputs it can reach later should route them to shared Drive. Other optional integrations (Notion, Webflow, Slack, Canva) unlock publishing, asset, and notification steps.

### Zero-config default (no setup needed)

Run `/contentforge:create-content` straight after install. Tracking and outputs go to local storage. Everything in the 10-phase pipeline works.

### Optional: Drive persistence for Cowork teams

Cowork supports **HTTP MCPs only** — stdio/`npx` MCP servers are a Claude Code CLI feature and cannot be added in Cowork.

**1. Connect Google Drive**
In Cowork: profile menu → **Settings** → **Integrations** → find **Google Drive** → **Connect**, and sign in with the account that owns your team's shared Drive.

**2. Run the setup skill**
```
/contentforge:cf-cowork-setup
```
It verifies the Cowork environment, confirms a Drive MCP is reachable, creates the canonical Drive folder layout, and persists the routing config. One run per team.

**What rides that persistence (v4.0):** everything under the brand directory — the profile and per-run checkpoints as before, plus the lifecycle stores the 4.0 loop depends on: `audits/` (recorded cf-audit findings that cf-calendar and content-refresh read across sessions), `aeo/checks.json` (AI-visibility history), and each run's telemetry files. On Cowork WITHOUT Drive routing these stores vanish with the session like everything else in the sandbox — the loop then still works within a session but cannot compound across sessions, which is most of its point. Teams that want the lifecycle loop should treat Drive routing as required, not optional.

**3. Verify**
```
/contentforge:cf-integrations
```
It lists what is connected and what each connector unlocks.

### Optional: other connectors

A fresh install ships an **empty** `.mcp.json` — zero connectors auto-connect. The full opt-in catalog of 16 HTTP connectors lives in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` in the plugin repo (Notion, Canva, Webflow, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Figma, fal.ai, Replicate, plus aggregator options — Pipedream, Composio, Zapier, Make).

Add one interactively:
```
/contentforge:cf-connect <name>
```

#### Quick Mode (All Parameters at Once)

Type:
```
/contentforge:create-content "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends" --type=article --brand=AcmeCorp --audience="Healthcare CIOs" --keyword="AI healthcare 2026"
```

Same pipeline runs, skips the prompts. **Use this when you know all parameters.**

---

### Command 2: `/contentforge:batch-process` (Work Through a Queue of 10-50+ Pieces)

**Use Case:** Agency needs 20 blog posts for multiple clients, produced unattended from one queue

Batch processing is **sequential**: one full 10-phase pipeline at a time, in priority order. It is not faster per piece than running each piece yourself — the win is that you set up the queue once and walk away. Every piece is checkpointed as it finishes, so an interrupted batch picks up where it stopped via `/contentforge:resume`.

#### Step 1: Prepare the Requirements Queue

Local tracking is the default and needs no setup. If your team uses the Google Sheets backend instead, create a sheet with these columns:
| requirement_id | content_type | title | target_audience | brand | word_count | priority | status |
|----------------|--------------|-------|-----------------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| REQ-001 | article | AI in Healthcare 2026 | Healthcare CIOs | AcmeCorp | 2000 | 1 | pending |
| REQ-002 | blog | 10 Remote Team Tips | HR Managers | TechStartup | 1500 | 2 | pending |
| REQ-003 | whitepaper | Future of SEO | Marketing Directors | AgencyCo | 4000 | 1 | pending |

**Important:**
- `status=pending` means "ready to process"
- `priority=1` is highest (urgent), `5` is lowest
- All brands must have profiles created (use `/contentforge:brand-setup` first)

#### Step 2: Make the Sheet Reachable (Google backend only)

Share the sheet with the Google account connected in **Settings → Integrations**, with Editor access. Skip this step entirely on the local backend.

#### Step 3: Run Batch Processing

In Cowork, type:
```
/contentforge:batch-process https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123XYZ/edit
```

**Cowork responds:**
```
✓ Loading requirements from Google Sheet...
✓ Found 12 rows

## Workflows for Different Use Cases

### Workflow 1: Freelance Content Writer (10 pieces/week)

**Goal:** Produce 10 high-quality blog posts per week for different clients

**Step 1: Setup (Monday morning, 30 min)**
- Create 3 brand profiles (one per client): `/contentforge:brand-setup`
- Fill the requirements queue with 10 rows (local tracking, or a Google Sheet if your team uses that backend)

**Step 2: Batch Process (Monday morning onward, unattended)**
- `/contentforge:batch-process https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/requirements`
- Let it work through the queue one piece at a time (10 blogs ≈ 5-6 hours)
- If the session drops, `/contentforge:resume` picks up from the last checkpoint

**Step 3: Quality Check (30 min)**
- Spot-check 3 random pieces
- Review any flagged for human review (<5.0 score)

**Step 4: Deliver**
- Collect all 10 .docx files from the batch output folder
- Send to clients via email or project management tool

**Time Saved:** you spend ~1 hour of hands-on time instead of writing 10 pieces yourself

---

### Workflow 2: Agency Managing 50 Brands

**Goal:** Produce 100 pieces/month across 50 brands

**Step 1: One-Time Setup (2-3 hours)**
- Create 50 brand profiles: `/contentforge:brand-setup` (repeat 50 times)
- Set up Google Sheet with columns for all requirements
- Configure optional CMS integrations (WordPress, Notion)

**Step 2: Monthly Planning (1st of month, 1 hour)**
- Fill Google Sheet with 100 requirements
- Assign priorities (urgent client campaigns = priority 1)
- Verify all brands have profiles

**Step 3: Batch Processing (1st-5th of month, mostly unattended)**
- Run 4-5 batch runs (20-25 pieces per batch)
- `/contentforge:batch-process https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/requirements`
- Each batch runs sequentially: ~12-15 hours for 20 pieces, spread across days and resumable

**Step 4: Quality Assurance (Ongoing)**
- Spot-check 10% of output (10 pieces)
- Review flagged content (<5% typically)

**Step 5: Publishing (5th-10th of month)**
- `/contentforge:publish` in bulk to client WordPress/Notion sites
- Or download and deliver via project management

**Step 6: Analytics (End of month)**
- `/contentforge:cf-analytics --days=30`
- Identify top-performing brands/types
- Optimize next month's strategy

**Time Saved:** 200-250 hours/month vs manual content creation

---

### Workflow 3: Regulated Industry (Pharma Brand)

**Goal:** Produce compliant, fact-checked content with zero hallucinations

**Step 1: Brand Setup with Strict Guardrails**
```
/contentforge:brand-setup PharmaCorpGlobal

Industry: Pharma
Voice: Authoritative
Tone: Formal
Guardrails:
  - All medical claims must be cited
  - Use "patients" not "consumers"
  - Avoid disease fearmongering
  - Comply with FDA/EMA regulations
  - Never mention off-label use
```

**Step 2: Generate Content with Extra Scrutiny**
```
/contentforge:create-content "New Diabetes Treatment Options in 2026" --type=whitepaper --brand=PharmaCorpGlobal --audience="Endocrinologists"
```

**Step 3: Review Quality Score Breakdown**
- **Target:** ≥9.0/10 overall, 100% brand compliance
- **Citation Integrity:** Must be 9.0+ (all claims cited to peer-reviewed sources)

**Step 4: Human Medical Review**
- Even if score is 9.5/10, have in-house medical writer review
- Verify all statistics against original sources
- Check regulatory compliance

**Step 5: Publish Only After Approval**
- Never auto-publish for regulated industries
- Use `/contentforge:publish` only after legal/medical sign-off

**Quality Assurance:** Three-layer fact verification + human review = zero compliance issues

### Key Concept: Feedback Loops

If a phase fails its quality gate, the pipeline **loops back** with specific feedback:

**Example: Hallucination Detected**
```
Phase 4: Scientific Validator
  ❌ Found unsourced claim: "85% of hospitals use AI by 2026"
  → Looping back to Phase 3 with feedback:
     "Claim '85% of hospitals...' needs citation. Check sources from Phase 2."

Phase 3: Content Drafter (Loop 1)
  → Rewrites paragraph
  → Adds citation: [Source: McKinsey Healthcare Report 2025]

Phase 4: Scientific Validator (Retry)
  ✓ All claims now traceable
  → Continues to Phase 5
```

**Max Loops:**
- Phase 4 → Phase 3: 2 loops
- Phase 7 → Any phase: 2 loops
- **Total: 5 iterations max** before human escalation

This prevents infinite loops while allowing quality improvements.

## Quality Scores & What They Mean

### 5-Dimension Scoring System

Every piece is scored across **5 dimensions** (weighted):

#### 1. Content Quality (30% weight)
**What it measures:**
- Depth of analysis
- Originality (not just rehashing existing content)
- Actionable insights
- Clarity and structure

**Scoring:**
- **9-10:** Exceptional depth, unique insights, highly actionable
- **7-8:** Good depth, some original angles, useful
- **5-6:** Basic coverage, minimal originality, somewhat useful
- **<5:** Superficial, repetitive, low value

#### 2. Citation Integrity (25% weight)
**What it measures:**
- Accuracy of citations
- Relevance to claims
- Authority of sources (peer-reviewed > blog)
- Freshness (2024-2026 sources > 2020)

**Scoring:**
- **9-10:** All citations accurate, highly authoritative, <2 years old
- **7-8:** 80-90% accurate, mostly authoritative, some older sources
- **5-6:** 60-80% accurate, mixed authority, many older sources
- **<5:** <60% accurate, weak sources, very outdated

#### 3. Brand Compliance (20% weight)
**What it measures:**
- Voice match (authoritative, conversational, etc.)
- Terminology adherence (approved terms used, banned terms avoided)
- Style guide compliance (formatting, citation style)
- Guardrails respected (no prohibited topics)

**Scoring:**
- **9-10:** Perfect voice match, 100% terminology compliance
- **7-8:** Good voice match, 1-2 minor terminology slips
- **5-6:** Voice mostly matches, 3-5 terminology issues
- **<5:** Voice mismatch, multiple guardrail violations

#### 4. SEO Performance (15% weight)
**What it measures:**
- Keyword density (target: 1.5-2.5%)
- Keyword placement (title, H2s, first para, conclusion)
- Meta tag optimization (title length, description)
- Readability for search engines

**Scoring:**
- **9-10:** Perfect keyword density, all placements hit, meta optimized
- **7-8:** Good density, most placements hit, minor meta issues
- **5-6:** Density off-target, missed some placements
- **<5:** Poor keyword usage, meta tags missing/bad

#### 5. Readability (10% weight)
**What it measures:**
- Grade level appropriate for content type
- Sentence variety (burstiness)
- Flow and coherence
- Grammar and spelling accuracy

**Scoring:**
- **9-10:** Perfect grade level, excellent flow, zero errors
- **7-8:** On-target grade level, good flow, 1-2 minor errors
- **5-6:** Slightly off-target grade level, choppy flow, 3-5 errors
- **<5:** Wrong grade level, poor flow, many errors

### Composite Score Calculation

**Example:**
- Content Quality: 9.5/10 × 30% = 2.85
- Citation Integrity: 9.0/10 × 25% = 2.25
- Brand Compliance: 9.5/10 × 20% = 1.90
- SEO Performance: 8.8/10 × 15% = 1.32
- Readability: 9.0/10 × 10% = 0.90

**Overall Score: 9.22/10** (rounds to 9.2)

### Decision Bands

These three bands come from `config/scoring-thresholds.json`, the single source of truth for every quality number:

- **≥7.0 — Approved.** Passes the composite gate and is delivered.
- **5.0-6.9 — Loop.** The pipeline sends the piece back to its weakest phase for rework. It is **never** auto-delivered at this score.
- **<5.0 — Human escalation.** The run stops and a person has to decide.

Note that the composite score is not the only gate: every dimension also has a floor (Citation Integrity ≥7.0, Brand Compliance ≥7.0, Content Quality / SEO / Readability ≥6.0). A piece can score 7.4 overall and still loop because one dimension sits under its floor. Regulated industries raise the bar further — Pharma, Healthcare, and Legal require ≥8.0; BFSI ≥7.5.

### What to Do Based on Score

**Score ≥7.0 (approved):** ✅ Delivered. Give it a read, then publish.

**Score 5.0-6.9 (loop band):** ⚠️ The pipeline already tried to fix it. If it reaches you at this score, its revision budget ran out:
- Check the dimension breakdown for the weakest one
- If Citation Integrity is low: add more authoritative sources
- If Brand Compliance is low: review the brand profile and terminology
- If SEO Performance is low: rerun Phase 6 with better keyword placement

**Score <5.0 (human escalation):** 🚫 Auto-flagged, never auto-published
- Review the run output for the specific failures
- Fix manually, or regenerate with a sharper brief

## Batch Processing for Agencies

### What Batch Processing Actually Does

Batch processing runs the **same** 10-phase pipeline you'd run by hand, once per queued piece, **one at a time**. It does not make any individual piece faster.

What it buys you:
- **Unattended operation** — queue 20 pieces, walk away, come back to 20 .docx files
- **Priority ordering** — urgent client work runs first
- **Checkpointed and resumable** — a dropped session doesn't lose completed pieces; `/contentforge:resume` continues the run
- **Per-piece status tracking** — every row ends as `completed`, `review_required`, or `failed`
- **Failure isolation** — one bad row doesn't halt the rest of the queue

**Plan the wall-clock time accordingly:** 20 blog posts ≈ 20 × 30-35 min ≈ 10-12 hours of sequential runtime.

### Setting Up Batch Processing

#### Queue Columns

The canonical required-column list lives in `agents/09-batch-orchestrator.md` (see **Required Columns**). Reproduced here for convenience:

| Column | Type | Description | Required | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| requirement_id | string | Unique ID | ✅ | REQ-001 |
| content_type | enum | article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research_paper | ✅ | article |
| title | string | Content topic/title | ✅ | "AI in Healthcare 2026" |
| target_audience | string | Who this is for | ✅ | "Healthcare CIOs" |
| brand | string | Brand profile name (must exist) | ✅ | "AcmeCorp" |
| word_count | integer | Target word count | ✅ | 2000 |
| priority | integer | 1-5 (1=highest) | ✅ | 1 |
| status | enum | pending, in_progress, completed, failed, review_required | ✅ | pending |
| primary_keyword | string | SEO keyword | ❌ | "AI healthcare" |
| notes | string | Special instructions | ❌ | "Mention new FDA regulations" |

**Important Rules:**
1. `status=pending` means "ready to process" (batch will skip others)
2. `priority=1` processes first, `priority=5` last
3. All brands must have profiles created first
4. Word count must be within the content type's canonical range in `config/scoring-thresholds.json` (blog 800-1500, article 1500-2000, whitepaper 2500-5000, research paper 4000-8000, FAQ 600-1200)

### Priority System Explained

**Priority Levels:**
- **1 (Urgent):** Client deadline tomorrow, campaign launch imminent
- **2 (High):** Important but not urgent, next week's content
- **3 (Normal):** Standard blog posts, regular cadence
- **4 (Low):** Evergreen content, no specific deadline
- **5 (Backlog):** Nice-to-have, filler content

**How Batch Processes Priorities:**
```
Queue before sorting:
  REQ-005 (Priority 3, Article)
  REQ-001 (Priority 1, Whitepaper)
  REQ-003 (Priority 2, Blog)
  REQ-002 (Priority 1, Article)

Queue after sorting:
  1. REQ-001 (Priority 1, Whitepaper) ← runs first, alone
  2. REQ-002 (Priority 1, Article)    ← starts only when REQ-001 finishes
  3. REQ-003 (Priority 2, Blog)
  4. REQ-005 (Priority 3, Article)
```

**Pro Tip:** Put anything with a hard deadline at priority 1 — the queue never runs two pieces at once, so position in the queue is what determines when a piece lands.

### Monitoring Batch Progress

**Progress report after each piece:**
```

╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**What to Watch:**
- **Now running:** Exactly one piece at a time — that's by design, not a stall
- **Failed:** Should be 0 (errors auto-retry once)
- **Avg Quality Score:** Should be ≥8.5 (if dropping, check brand profiles)
- **Est. Remaining:** Recalculated from the running average as pieces complete

### Error Handling in Batch

**Auto-Retry Errors:**
- API rate limit → waits 60s, retries
- Network timeout → retries immediately
- Source URL unavailable → tries alternate sources

**Human Escalation:**
- Brand profile not found → marks as `failed`, continues with remaining
- Validation errors (missing fields) → marks as `failed`, saves to `failed-requirements.csv`
- Score still 5.0-6.9 after the loop limits are exhausted → marks as `review_required`, never `completed`
- Score <5.0 → marks as `review_required` and escalates to a human

**What Happens to Failed/Review-Required:**
- Batch continues with remaining pieces (doesn't halt entire batch)
- Tracking row status updated to `failed` or `review_required`
- Summary report at end lists all issues

## Content Refresh

### When to Refresh vs. Create New

**Refresh (Update Existing) When:**
- Content is 6-24 months old
- Core thesis is still valid
- Content has backlinks or SEO equity
- Topic is evergreen with updated stats available
- Original scored ≥7.0/10

**Create New (Don't Refresh) When:**
- Content is 24+ months old
- Core thesis outdated (industry changed)
- Topic is no longer relevant
- Original scored <5.0/10
- Starting from scratch is faster

### Refresh Scopes Explained

#### Light Refresh (20% rewrite, 8-12 min)
**What Changes:**
- Update statistics to current year (2024 → 2026)
- Replace 1-2 outdated examples
- Fix broken citation links
- Refresh intro sentence

**What Stays:**
- All structure (H2/H3 headings)
- 80% of original paragraphs
- Target keywords unchanged

**Use Case:** Content is 6-12 months old, mostly accurate, just needs stats updated

**Example:**
```
Original (2025):
  "In 2024, 62% of hospitals used AI for diagnostics..."

Refreshed (2026):
  "In 2025, 68% of hospitals used AI for diagnostics..."
```

#### Medium Refresh (50% rewrite, 15-20 min)
**What Changes:**
- Rewrite intro and conclusion completely
- Update 40-60% of body paragraphs
- Add 3-5 new sections for emerging trends
- Replace 50% of citations with current sources

**What Stays:**
- Article structure (same H2 sections, order may change)
- Evergreen definitions, frameworks, principles
- Target keywords (may add 2-3 new secondary keywords)

**Use Case:** Content is 12-24 months old, core is valid but needs significant updates

**Example:**
```
Original H2 Sections (2025):
  1. Introduction
  2. AI in Diagnostics
  3. AI in Treatment Planning

#### Heavy Refresh (80% rewrite, 22-30 min)
**What Changes:**
- Complete rewrite using original as outline only
- New research from scratch (Phase 1 full run)
- Update target keywords based on current search intent
- Add 5-10 new sections
- Replace 80% of citations

**What Stays:**
- Core topic and brand voice
- 1-2 evergreen sections (definitions, historical context)
- SEO URL slug (to preserve backlinks)

**Use Case:** Content is 24+ months old, industry has changed significantly, needs near-complete overhaul

**Example:**
```
Original (2024): "AI in Healthcare: 2024 Predictions"
  → Title, stats, examples all outdated

Heavy Refresh → "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Reality and 2028 Outlook"
  → New title, all new sections, 80% new content
  → Preserves URL: /blog/ai-healthcare-predictions (backlinks maintained)
```

### SEO Preservation Strategy

**Critical:** Content refresh must NOT hurt your SEO rankings.

**How ContentForge Preserves SEO:**

1. **Keyword Density Maintained:**
   - Original: 2.3% for "AI in healthcare"
   - Target for refresh: 2.0-2.6% (±0.3%)
   - Phase 6 monitors and adjusts rewritten sections

2. **URL Slug Preserved:**
   - Original: `/blog/ai-in-healthcare-2025-trends`
   - Refreshed: `/blog/ai-in-healthcare-2025-trends` (**SAME URL**)
   - Title updates to "2026 Trends" but URL stays (maintains backlinks)

3. **Internal Links Preserved:**
   - All internal links from original content are preserved
   - New internal links added to related updated content
   - Never break existing internal link structure

4. **Meta Description Updated (Not Replaced):**
   - Original: "Explore AI in healthcare trends for 2025..."
   - Refreshed: "Explore AI in healthcare trends for 2026..." (year updated)

### Version Control

**Original File:** `AI-in-Healthcare-2025-Trends_v1.0.docx` (never modified)
**1st Refresh:** `AI-in-Healthcare-2025-Trends_v1.1.docx` (new version)
**2nd Refresh:** `AI-in-Healthcare-2025-Trends_v1.2.docx`
**Heavy Refresh:** `AI-in-Healthcare-2025-Trends_v2.0.docx`

**Why Version Control Matters:**
- Rollback if refresh hurts SEO
- A/B test original vs. refreshed
- Track improvement over time

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Brand profile not found"

**Error Message:**
```
❌ Error: Brand profile 'AcmeCorp' not found
Action: Run /contentforge:brand-setup AcmeCorp first
```

**Cause:** You haven't created a brand profile yet.

**Solution:**
1. Run `/contentforge:brand-setup AcmeCorp`
2. Fill in brand details (voice, tone, terminology)
3. Retry content generation

---

### Issue 2: "Quality score <5.0, flagged for review"

**Error Message:**
```
⚠️ Quality Score: 4.8/10 (below threshold)
Dimension Breakdown:
  Content Quality: 7.5/10
  Citation Integrity: 3.2/10 ← FAILING
  Brand Compliance: 8.0/10
  SEO Performance: 7.0/10
  Readability: 7.5/10

Reason: 6/15 citations are broken (404 errors)
Action: Review citations, fix broken URLs, rerun
```

**Cause:** Content didn't meet quality threshold (likely citation issues).

**Solution:**
1. Check dimension breakdown (identify failing dimension)
2. If Citation Integrity <5.0:
   - Phase 2 found broken links
   - Manually verify sources are still live
   - Consider using more authoritative sources (peer-reviewed journals, not blogs)
3. Regenerate with better sources:
   ```
   /contentforge:create-content "AI in Healthcare 2026" --type=article --brand=AcmeCorp
   ```
   Provide hint: "Use peer-reviewed sources from Nature, NEJM, JAMA"

---

### Issue 3: "Max loops exceeded (5 iterations)"

**Error Message:**
```
❌ Max loops exceeded: 5 iterations
Pipeline stuck in feedback loop between Phase 4 and Phase 3

Loop History:
  Loop 1: Phase 4 → Phase 3 (hallucination: "95% of doctors use AI")
  Loop 2: Phase 4 → Phase 3 (hallucination: "AI reduces costs by 80%")
  Loop 3: Phase 7 → Phase 3 (citation integrity: 4.5/10)
  Loop 4: Phase 4 → Phase 3 (unsourced claim: "FDA approved 12 AI tools")
  Loop 5: Phase 7 → Phase 6 (SEO degraded readability)

Action: Human review required. Issue likely: vague topic or restrictive sources.
```

**Cause:** Pipeline can't meet quality gates after 5 attempts (usually vague topic or limited sources).

**Solution:**
1. **Make topic more specific:**
   - Instead of: "AI in Healthcare"
   - Try: "AI-Powered Diagnostics for Cardiovascular Disease"

2. **Check if sources are paywalled:**
   - If topic requires medical journals behind paywalls, ContentForge can't access them
   - Provide publicly accessible sources in your brief

3. **Relax brand guardrails temporarily:**
   - If brand profile has very restrictive guardrails, loosen them
   - `/contentforge:brand-setup AcmeCorp` → Edit guardrails

4. **Try different content type:**
   - If article is stuck, try blog (shorter, less citations needed)

---

### Issue 4: "MCP server connection failed"

**Error Message:**
```
❌ MCP Error: google-drive server not responding
Check MCP configuration in Cowork settings
```

**Cause:** the Google Drive integration isn't connected, or its authorization expired.

**Solution:**
1. **Check the integration in Cowork:**
   - Profile → Settings → Integrations
   - Verify **Google Drive** shows as connected; reconnect if it doesn't

2. **Re-run the setup skill:**
   - `/contentforge:cf-cowork-setup` re-verifies the Drive MCP and folder layout
   - `/contentforge:cf-integrations` lists what's currently connected

3. **Check any path you configured by hand:**
   - Use a fully-expanded absolute path — `~` is not expanded by every MCP host
   - Good: `/Users/you/ContentForge/output`
   - Risky: `~/ContentForge/output`

4. **Test Connection:**
   - In Cowork: "List files in my Google Drive folder 'ContentForge Output'"
   - If this works, the integration is live

5. **Restart Cowork:**
   - Log out and log back in
   - Integrations reload on session start

**Remember:** Drive is optional. If it stays broken, ContentForge falls back to local tracking and still produces the .docx.

### Issue 5: "Processing time well over the expected range"

**Error Message:**
```
⚠️ Warning: Processing time 78 minutes (article range: 35-45 min)
Phase 3 (Content Drafter) took 18 minutes (expected 5-7 min)
```

**Cause:** API rate limits, network issues, or unusually complex content.

**Solution:**
1. **Check integration quotas (if you use Drive/Sheets):**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
   - Check Drive API and Sheets API quotas
   - If near limit, wait or increase quota

2. **Retry Later:**
   - ContentForge auto-retries with backoff
   - If network issue, wait 10-15 min and retry

3. **Simplify Content:**
   - Reduce word count target (2000 → 1500)
   - Choose simpler content type (article → blog)

## FAQ

### General

**Q: How long does it take to set up ContentForge?**
**A:** 5-10 minutes total:
- Installation from the Plugins panel: 2 min
- First brand profile: 3-5 min
- Integrations: 0 min — none are required; add Drive later if your team needs shared persistence

**Q: Can I use ContentForge for free?**
**A:** Yes! ContentForge is free and open-source (MIT License). You only pay for:
- Your Claude Cowork subscription (if not already subscribed)
- Google Cloud API usage — only if you opt into the Drive/Sheets backend (free tier covers ~100 pieces/month)

**Q: How many brands can I manage?**
**A:** Unlimited. Agencies manage 50-200 brands. Each brand is a separate profile.

---

### Content Quality

**Q: How accurate are the citations?**
**A:** 95%+ accuracy. Three-layer verification (Phases 2, 4, 7) catches:
- Broken links (404 errors)
- Misattributed quotes
- Outdated statistics
- Fabricated sources

**Q: What about hallucinations?**
**A:** ContentForge applies three-layer fact verification (Phases 2, 4, 7). Production runs typically achieve high factual accuracy — verify every claim before publishing. Phase 4 (Scientific Validator) scans for:
- Fabricated statistics ("95% of doctors...")
- Made-up studies ("Harvard 2025 study found...")
- Unsourced claims

If detected, loops back to Phase 3 for rewrite.

**Q: Can I trust the quality scores?**
**A:** Treat them as a structured, repeatable review — the score tells you which of the 5 dimensions is weakest and whether the piece cleared the ≥7.0 approval gate. It is not a prediction of how the piece will rank; nothing in ContentForge measures search performance.

**Q: What if I disagree with the quality score?**
**A:** Review the dimension breakdown. If you think Citation Integrity should be higher:
1. Check the specific citations flagged
2. Verify sources are authoritative (peer-reviewed > blog)
3. If you disagree, use the content anyway (scores are guidance, not law)

---

### Batch Processing

**Q: Can I process more than 50 pieces at once?**
**A:** Yes, but split into batches of 20-30 so each run is easier to supervise. The queue is sequential, so plan on roughly (pieces × per-piece time) of wall-clock runtime — 100 blog posts is on the order of 50-60 hours across several sessions.

**Q: What happens if one piece fails in a batch?**
**A:** Batch continues with remaining pieces. The failed piece is marked `failed` or `review_required` in the tracking rows. Batch doesn't halt.

**Q: Can I cancel a batch mid-process?**
**A:** There's no cancel command, but closing the session stops the run — the batch does **not** continue in the background. Nothing already finished is lost: each completed piece is checkpointed, so `/contentforge:resume` picks the queue back up where it stopped.

---

### MCP & Integrations

**Q: Do I need to pay for Google Cloud?**
**A:** Free tier covers ~100 pieces/month. If you exceed:
- Drive API: $0.004 per 1,000 requests (very cheap)
- Sheets API: $0.004 per 1,000 requests

**Q: Can I use Dropbox instead of Google Drive?**
**A:** Google Drive is the only file-storage integration with a dedicated MCP path. But you don't need one: set `CONTENTFORGE_PUBLISH_DIR` to a folder your Dropbox (or OneDrive, or any sync client) already watches, and finished files land there via normal local output.

**Q: Can I publish to WordPress automatically?**
**A:** Yes, once a WordPress connector is available in your environment:
1. Add it with `/contentforge:cf-connect wordpress` (or Cowork Settings → Integrations)
2. Provide your WordPress site URL, username, and application password
3. Use `/contentforge:publish article.docx --platform=wordpress`

---

### Pricing & Limits

**Q: Is there a limit to how much content I can generate?**
**A:** Only limited by:
- Google Cloud API quotas (free tier: ~100 pieces/month)
- Claude Cowork usage (depends on your plan)

**Q: Does batch processing cost more?**
**A:** No. Batch processing runs the same pipeline, the same number of times — it just does the queueing for you.

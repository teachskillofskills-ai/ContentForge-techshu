## [4.1.2] - 2026-08-17

### Schema-clean hooks manifest (suite-wide fix from digital-marketing-pro#9)

- `hooks/hooks.json` carried a `_readme` rationale field that Cowork's plugin
  validation rejects as an unknown top-level key — the same defect shipped in
  all three suite plugins. The rationale text moved verbatim to
  `hooks/README.md`; `hooks.json` is now exactly `{"hooks": {}}`.
- New `TestHooksManifestSchemaClean` guard: hooks.json must contain the
  `hooks` key and nothing else, and the rationale doc must exist.
- The 11 README translations re-stamped to v4.1.2 (no user-facing README
  content changed; the stamp guard requires the conscious re-stamp).
- Tests: 520 → 522.

---

## [4.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### The README goes global, and shows its receipts

**Twelve languages.**

- 11 full translations at repo root: `README.hi.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`,
  `README.ja.md`, `README.ko.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.pt-BR.md`,
  `README.ar.md`, `README.ur.md`, `README.ta.md`, `README.bn.md`,
  `README.ru.md` — each a curated, self-sufficient translation (install on all
  nine platforms + claude.ai + ChatGPT/AP1.0, quick start, real-run results,
  updating, FAQ essentials) that names the English README as source of truth
  and carries a "Synced with English README vX.Y.Z" stamp.
- New `tests/test_readme_translations.py`: every translation file must exist,
  carry the byte-identical language-switcher line, link back to README.md,
  and be stamped with the CURRENT canonical version — a translation that
  silently falls behind the shipping release fails the suite (stamp regex
  plant-checked). The English README must carry the switcher line naming
  every translation.

**Real artifacts embedded in Examples.**

- The validated 2026-08-16 run's actual outputs, sourced from its JSON
  artifacts: the rendered link-rot benchmarks chart
  (`docs/assets/real-run/link-rot-benchmarks-chart.png`), the delivered
  opening prose, three verbatim before→after humanizer edits from the Phase
  6.5 report, the run auditor's CLEAN verdict, and a scorecard SVG
  (`docs/assets/real-run-scorecard.svg`) — overall 9.0/A APPROVED, dimensions
  8.8/8.9/9.6/8.6/8.8, 42 claims zero hallucinations, 14/0/1 audit, real
  phase durations including Phase 8 surviving two session drops.
- The run brand is an internal validation persona (not client work); its
  branded feature card is deliberately NOT embedded — only unbranded
  artifacts ship in the README.

**OpenAI surfaces documented at full depth.**

- New README section "ContentForge on OpenAI surfaces — Codex and ChatGPT":
  the mechanical Codex walkthrough (manifest discovery, AGENTS.md auto-load,
  intent invocation, the portable execution lane's sequential-phases
  guarantee, shared storage), the honest Agent Plugins 1.0 / ChatGPT status
  (package listing-ready; directory listing is an owner-side submission), and
  the per-surface contract summary for Cursor / Copilot CLI / Antigravity /
  Grok / Hermes / OpenClaw.
- Updating section now covers all nine platforms + claude.ai `.skill`
  re-uploads in a per-surface table (it previously detailed only the Claude
  family).

**Author presence.**

- `docs/assets/author-banner.svg` (maintainer identity + TechShu suite +
  sponsor call-to-action) linked at the top of the README to GitHub Sponsors;
  language-switcher line added at the very top.

Tests: 514 → 520.

---

## [4.1.0] - 2026-08-17

### Two new surfaces: Grok native support + claude.ai hero-skill release assets

**Grok (xAI Build CLI) is the ninth native platform.**

- New `.grok-plugin/plugin.json` (mirrors the Claude manifest, plus the
  `"skills": "./skills/"` pointer Grok's loader uses) and
  `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json` (single-plugin marketplace source, so
  `grok plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu` works directly).
- Grok also reads the Claude Code manifests for compatibility
  ([Grok Build docs](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/skills-plugins-marketplaces));
  the native pair is the first-class lane and what an official xAI marketplace
  listing points at.
- Both files are version-locked in `tests/test_release_consistency.py`
  (`PLATFORM_MANIFESTS_JSON` now has 8 entries; a dedicated test pins the
  marketplace entry's version and source URL). The README platform-name guard,
  the AGENTS.md surfaces guard, and the install-command guard all now require
  Grok.

**Five hero skills ship as claude.ai-uploadable `.skill` release assets.**

- New `config/skill-assets.json` declares which skills are safe standalone on
  claude.ai — `cf-brief`, `cf-social-adapt`, `cf-translate`, `cf-video-script`,
  `cf-aeo-check` — plus the repo-level config/template files each SKILL.md
  references (e.g. `cf-social-adapt` bundles `config/social-platform-specs.json`
  and `templates/social-post-templates.md`).
- New `scripts/build-skill-assets.py` packages each as `dist/<skill>.skill`:
  one top-level skill directory, dependencies copied to the same relative paths
  the prose references (so nothing dangles after upload), exactly one SKILL.md,
  claude.ai's 200-file cap enforced from the manifest, and byte-identical
  deterministic rebuilds. It **refuses to package** a skill whose SKILL.md
  references `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (no plugin root exists on claude.ai) or an
  undeclared repo path.
- New `tests/test_skill_assets.py` (13 tests): manifest integrity, portability
  scan green for every declared skill, both refusal paths plant-checked, built
  zip shape (single top dir / one SKILL.md / under cap / extras present), and
  build determinism. The pipeline skill is guard-excluded from the manifest —
  it needs subagent dispatch and must never masquerade as a standalone upload.
- `dist/` gitignored; assets are attached to GitHub releases, not committed.
  Install path documented in the README's Supported surfaces table and
  cross-platform matrix (claude.ai → enable *Code execution and file creation*
  → Customize → Skills → Upload skill).

**Docs and guards.**

- README: platforms badge 8→9 native (anchor `#supported-surfaces-v410`), Grok
  and claude.ai rows in Supported surfaces + cross-platform matrix, install
  commands in the hero block, v4.1.0 release notes.
- AGENTS.md surfaces line and TESTING-GUIDE checklist updated to 9 native.
- Corrected the v4.0.0 release-note test tally in the README: 4.0.0 shipped
  464 → 498 (the note said 468, a mid-release artifact).
- Tests: 498 → 514.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-17

### The lifecycle release

ContentForge 3.x was a production pipeline that made excellent pieces and forgot
them. 4.0 makes production, measurement, and planning one auditable system. The
release implements the first three findings of the graph/loop analysis
(2026-08-17), each grounded in a defect a real run exposed; the two follow-on
stores are deliberately specified-not-built at
`research/2026-08-17-link-graph-and-claim-library-spec.md`.

### Added — the lifecycle loop, closed by file contracts

- **`scripts/audit-ledger.py`** — the canonical, durable output of
  `/contentforge:audit-content`. Records schema-validated audit findings
  (pieces with freshness scores, ranked refresh priorities, recommended scopes,
  reasons; gap topics; retire candidates; and a REQUIRED
  `aeo_history_considered` field, because "not consulted" and "consulted, no
  signal" must never be the same answer) into `{brand}/audits/`, atomically.
  `latest` / `list` / `validate` actions; exit 1 lists every schema problem.
  Before this contract, cf-calendar's documented read of "the most recent
  cf-audit output" resolved to nothing once the session ended — the loop
  existed and broke exactly there, the same defect class the pipeline itself
  cured in v3.16 (file-based phase handoff) and v3.27 (corrections with no
  destination), now cured at the between-skills level.
- **cf-calendar and content-refresh read the recorded audit by file**
  (`audit-ledger.py latest`) — ranked candidates become refresh slots, gap
  topics become new-content slots, recommended scopes drive refresh depth.
  Exit 1 (nothing recorded) is said out loud, never reconstructed from memory.
- **cf-aeo-check history feeds the freshness model** — pieces whose recorded AI
  citations were lost since the previous check take a named deduction (up to 15
  points, 5 per lost citation); a brand with no `aeo/checks.json` gets the
  explicit n/a, never a silent skip.
- **The verified link inventory stops evaporating with the run** — Phase 1 now
  also writes `phase-1-link-inventory.json` (data rows of the recon-verified
  pages), and after Gate 1 the orchestrator merges it via
  `harvest-brand-pages.py --merge-inventory`: service/product and authority
  pages upsert by normalized URL with `verified_live` stamps, manual curation
  is never overwritten, informational rows are skipped-and-counted, and
  **conversion rows only ever STAGE under `brand_pages.recon_candidates`** — a
  CTA is a commercial decision, and the merge collects the evidence without
  making the decision. Closes the owner to-do a live run's Phase 7 had to hand
  back to the user.

### Added — the pipeline contract as data

- **`config/pipeline-graph.json`** — nodes, reads/writes edges, gates, and
  budgeted loop edges, declared once. `tests/test_pipeline_contract_graph.py`
  drift-guards it BOTH directions against the agent contracts (every contracted
  input mentioned, every mentioned artifact contracted), the orchestrator's
  table, `checkpoint-manager.py`'s phase order, and `run-audit.py`'s artifact
  expectations. Encoding the prose table immediately surfaced six
  under-declared inputs — including Phase 8's real dependency on the SEO
  scorecard and humanization report, Phase 5's on the annotated draft whose
  VISUAL anchors must survive, and Phase 4's on the research artifact its own
  file annotates as "was missing from this list" after a previous drift.
  The SKILL.md contract table now names the graph as authoritative.

### Added — telemetry with floors

- **`scripts/telemetry.py`** — read-only cross-run aggregation: `loops` (edge
  fire counts by content type, loop reasons, per-phase timing summaries from
  the tracker's real ISO stamps), `patterns` (humanizer per-pattern totals and
  run-presence), `advisories` (brief lines behind a recurrence floor).
- **`phase-6.5-pattern-hits.json`** — the humanizer's new companion artifact:
  `{pattern_id: count}` for every catalog pattern that fired, counted honestly
  (instances fixed, not sentences touched). The report stays for humans; this
  file is for the loop.
- **The orchestrator injects advisories into the Phase 3 brief** only when
  telemetry says `status: ok` — below the floor (default: a pattern seen in ≥3
  instrumented runs) the answer is `insufficient_history` and nothing is
  advised. Pre-4.0 runs count as `not_instrumented` — unknown, never zero.
  **Advisories never modify a gate, a threshold, or a verdict** — stated in the
  contract beside the step, and pinned by test.
- **cf-analytics renders loop-edge and pattern panels** from telemetry output —
  an edge that fires across many runs of one content type is presented as what
  it is: a contract problem worth a template fix, not a run problem.

### Changed

- README rewritten end to end for 4.0: lifecycle section with diagrams
  (`docs/assets/pipeline-dag.svg`, `docs/assets/lifecycle-loop.svg`), a
  from-a-real-run example with the F-1 catch story, data-layout map,
  consolidated release notes, refreshed FAQ/troubleshooting.
- COWORK-GUIDE: the lifecycle stores ride the brand-directory Drive sync — and
  without Drive routing the loop cannot compound across sessions, which is most
  of its point.
- Shared manifest description updated across the five Claude-family manifests
  (byte-identical, guard-checked): "content lifecycle system".
- Loader contract fix in the three new scripts: `_common.load_json_safe`
  returns an 'error'-keyed dict, never None — normalized at every call site
  (the tests caught the wrong assumption before it shipped).

### Tests

- `tests/test_pipeline_contract_graph.py` (12) — graph shape, order sync with
  both scripts, artifact drift both directions, SKILL-table completeness,
  plant-checks.
- `tests/test_lifecycle_loop.py` (22) — audit-ledger roundtrip + eight
  schema plants + brand mismatch; merge semantics (refresh vs add vs stage vs
  skip, idempotence, www/trailing-slash identity, CLI roundtrip through the
  real argv path); telemetry aggregation, unknown-vs-zero, advisory floor
  both sides, loud unreadable runs; wiring guards on every contract edge.
- Tests 464 → 498, alongside the v3.17.x interconnection suite
  (`tests/test_pipeline_graph.py`), which remains in force unchanged.

## [3.33.4] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — figure furniture is not prose, and the conclusion is not the references

Two more measurement-convention gaps from the same live customer-perspective run,
both proven on the run's own artifacts before and after the fix.

- **`body_word_count` counted the approved visual layer as article prose.** Three
  embedded figures' descriptive alt texts and italic caption lines moved the
  measured body from 1,274 gate-passed words to 1,501 against a 1,200 target —
  so the final `run-audit.py` word check would have failed a run whose prose
  never changed, for having its charts described properly. Block image embeds
  and the caption line directly beneath each are now excluded; the Pipeline
  Contract's stated counting convention names the exclusion (the convention doc
  existed precisely because unstated conventions had already produced a
  1,223-vs-1,390 verdict flip once). After the fix the article-only extract and
  the full file measure identically: 1,293.
- **`in_conclusion` read the file tail, not the conclusion.** The zone was the
  last 200 words of the document — on any finished article, the References
  section — and the explicit-conclusion fallback prepended only the section's
  heading text. A keyword present in the Conclusion measured as absent. The zone
  is now the Conclusion section's own text (or the pre-appendix tail when no
  conclusion heading exists).
- Four regression tests, each verified failing against the shipped 3.33.3
  module: references-tail masking, pre-appendix fallback, figure furniture
  excluded, standalone italic prose still counted. Tests 460 → 464.

## [3.33.3] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — a valid anchor the measurement could not see

The first fully-live customer-perspective run on 3.33.x (Phases 1–3.5 with the real
subagents, orchestrator-verified gates) produced a deterministic four-layer diagram
whose `<!-- VISUAL: … -->` anchor carried `->` arrows in its description —
"dropped pages -> Layer 1 capture" — and `text-metrics.py`'s marker regex used a
`[^>]` character class that stopped at the first `>`. The anchor was valid; the
measurement could not see it. Phase 3.5 had replaced every placeholder and verified
its own work, and Gate 8 would still have reported the diagram unanchored — the
same "measurement excludes the thing it measures" class as the v3.28.0 finding,
from the opposite direction.

- `text-metrics.py` `_VISUAL_MARKER_RE`: `[^>]*?` → `(.*?)` (non-greedy to the
  first `-->`; a `>` inside an HTML comment is legal). `run-audit.py` inherits the
  fix — it parses anchors through this module.
- `generate-docx.py` `INTERNAL_LINK_PATTERN`: same class, same fix — a `>` inside
  an attribute would have rendered the whole marker as a raw HTML comment instead
  of a hyperlink.
- Four regression tests, each proven against the shipped 3.33.2 parser (which
  returns count 0 on the arrow anchor): the arrow anchor parses with its id, and
  adjacent arrow-bearing markers stay two markers — the wider capture may not
  merge them. Tests 456 → 460.

## [3.33.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — the documentation truth pass

A from-zero audit of every live document, prompted by the question "is everything
actually updated?", found the doc-count guard pattern-blind: it required a number
directly before one of three nouns, and every stale count in the repo was phrased
some other way.

- **README** said "All 21 SKILL.md files" and "all 21 ContentForge skills" — the repo
  ships 22.
- **AGENTS.md** — the file every non-Claude runtime auto-loads — pinned "Supported
  surfaces (v3.22.0)" and listed only 4 of the 8 native surfaces. It now carries the
  current version, all 8 surfaces, and the Agent Plugins 1.0 lane.
- **docs/USER-GUIDE.md** said "17 Python scripts"; **TESTING-GUIDE.md**'s versioning
  checklist pinned v3.8.0-era numbers ("8 scripts", "not 9-phase") — eleven releases
  stale, telling a tester to fail a correct install. The checklist is now
  version-agnostic and points at the sources of truth instead of restating them.
- **docs/distribution/submission-bundle.md** claimed an "11-phase" pipeline against the
  canonical 10 — the first number a directory reviewer would check — and pinned a
  release version in its release-notes section; both fixed, the latter made
  version-agnostic so it cannot rot.
- **SUBMISSION.md** and **ContentForge-PRD-Blueprint.md** are now banner-marked
  HISTORICAL DOCUMENT: the May-2026 submission packet is superseded by
  `docs/distribution/submission-bundle.md`, and the founding PRD describes the plan,
  not the shipped product.

### Changed — the guard can now see what rotted

`tests/test_doc_counts.py` grew the patterns the audit proved necessary: script counts
(including "N Python scripts"), "N SKILL.md files", "N ContentForge skills",
comparison-table "Skills count" rows, a phase-count consistency check (everything says
10-phase or fails), and AGENTS.md currency (version = manifest, all 8 surfaces named).
Release-narrative sections keep their ship-time numbers via heading-aware exemptions,
and each new pattern is plant-checked against the exact phrasing that previously
escaped. Tests 452 → 456.

## [3.33.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed — richer Agent Plugins 1.0 listing metadata + submission bundle

The root `plugin.json` now carries the official schema's full optional set —
`homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords` — verified against the
published schema at agent-plugins.org (closed schema, 10 permitted fields).
Schema guards widened to the official field list. Added
`docs/distribution/submission-bundle.md`: listing metadata, starter prompts,
and the 5-positive + 3-negative test cases both official directories require —
ready for the owner to submit.

## [3.33.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added — the run auditor, shipped

`scripts/run-audit.py` re-derives every claim a finished run makes from the
artifacts on disk, using the plugin's own scripts. Checks: completed phases vs
artifacts, orphaned artifacts in finalized runs, production scaffolding in the
delivered body, generated assets without anchors, ghost manifest paths, the
authorship record vs a fresh measurement, fix-ledger regressions, APPROVED
decisions backed by their own scores, loop arithmetic and history, and statuses
that hide blocked publications. Every check is a failure class observed on a
real run while every individual artifact looked healthy. A missing input
downgrades a check to reported-N/A, never to silent-pass; `--strict` fails on
N/A for CI use. Verdict lands in `run-audit.json` inside the run.

**`finalize --status completed` now refuses without a fresh CLEAN verdict.**
`--skip-audit` finalizes anyway and stamps `audit_skipped: true` into the
manifest — the absence of verification becomes part of the record. Finalizing
as `blocked` needs no audit, because it claims nothing.

First contact with the real remediated run: three true findings, including a
stored authorship record one correction staler than the delivered body, and a
loop history that predates the history feature (reported N/A with the reason,
not failed — absence of the key dates the run).

### Added — the deterministic feature card

`scripts/feature_card.py`: a 1200×630 og:image card rendered from the brand's
recorded colors and the piece's real title. No AI generation, nothing invented —
colors are rejected unless they are the profile's own `#RRGGBB` values, text
artists are asserted before the file is written, size is verified off disk, and
the result is deterministic per environment with its sha256 in the record. It
closes the last blocker class with no pipeline-native exit: a run once ended
publication-BLOCKED on a missing feature image while correctly declining AI
generation, because AI was the only path the contract offered. The card still
requires user approval before becoming og:image — it is the piece's public face
— but a permanently open item became a candidate to approve.

**22 new tests**, including plants for every auditor guard and the finalize
gate refusing an unaudited or violating run.

## [3.32.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added — Agent Plugins 1.0 packaging + the portable execution lane

OpenAI's Agent Plugins 1.0 (2026-08-06; ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
VS Code, Kiro) is now a first-class target:

- Root `plugin.json` on the closed AP1.0 schema, version-synced with the Claude
  manifest and guarded by tests (closed-schema check, name rules, skills layout).
- `${PLUGIN_DATA}` accepted wherever `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` was (CF `_common`,
  and the same change shipped to DMP and SF resolvers) — a compliant non-Claude
  host previously resolved no data directory at all.
- **Portable execution lane** in the orchestrator skill: on platforms without
  subagent dispatch the pipeline runs sequentially in-conversation — each agent
  contract read as that phase's instructions, same artifacts, same gates, same
  loop budgets; context discipline replaces context isolation.

### Fixed — visual-layer contract reconciliation

- Phase 3.5 said three times "Phase 8 embeds only approved images" while Phase 8
  says approval gates AI imagery only — the contradiction that made a real run
  embed zero of its four valid deterministic figures. All three statements now
  carry the deterministic-assets exemption.
- Label-bearing diagrams are routed off the AI image path entirely: the
  no-text-in-generated-images rule made the AI path structurally incapable of a
  labeled diagram, and two instructions still sent labeled diagrams there.
- Deterministic diagrams are a first-class category with a naming rule
  (`{run_id}-diagram-{nn}.png`), honest attribution for schematics that plot no
  data, and a defined `feature-image` placement value for document-level assets.

### Added — reviewer RE-REVIEW MODE

Scoring after an out-of-band remediation is now specified: preserve the prior
review as `phase-7-review-pre-remediation.json` (declared in the Pipeline
Contract), re-measure every body-fed sub-score against the delivered text,
inherit only what demonstrably could not move, consume no loop budget, and read
humanization quality from a fresh scan rather than a stale report. Comparative
percentiles require at least 5 prior pieces — the formula once ranked a piece
against itself.

### Fixed — Phase 8 render path

Step 2.0 wrote to a separate `output/{type}/{date}/` tree that both observed
real runs ignored; the contract now matches practice (artifacts render beside
the run's evidence; the tracking dual-copy remains the user-visible delivery).

**17 new tests.**

## [3.31.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — the newline tolerance planted the very churn it was built to prevent

Found by an independent validation pass adversarially re-testing 3.31.0's newest
code. `locate` correctly matched an LF-composed `find` against a CRLF body and
handed back the CRLF-form match — but the LF-composed `replace` was substituted
verbatim, planting a bare LF in the middle of a CRLF file. Mixed endings are
exactly the churn the byte-stability work exists to prevent: the next
universal-newline read/write cycle rewrites the file and breaks any recorded
sha256.

Fixing it exposed the twin: once `apply` writes the body's convention, `verify`'s
literal `in` check reports the correctly applied multi-line fix as `regressed` —
another false accusation manufactured by an encoding detail. `match_newlines`
now gives every replacement the convention of the text it replaces (LF bodies
stay LF — the convention follows the file, not the platform), and `verify` and
`resolve` compare with the same tolerance `locate` matches with.

**4 new tests**, plant-checked: with the fix reverted, the suite fails.

## [3.31.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — the gate's evidence was not evidence

Gate 4 cited `fix-ledger.py validate` exiting 0 as proof a run's correction
ledger was sound. `validate` only checked JSON structure — **it never opened the
draft** — so a ledger whose every `find` string matched nothing was perfectly
well-formed and passed. That is the hollow-gate defect the ledger was built to
cure, reproduced inside the cure. Found by a validation agent running the shipped
contract against a planted draft, which observed that the only command proving a
ledger can land is `apply --dry-run`, which the contract never mentions.

`validate --target <draft>` now confirms every unresolved `find` resolves to
exactly one place, reports `unmatched` and `ambiguous` ids, and exits 1 when a
correction cannot land. Gate 4 requires `--target`; without it the command says
in its own output that it proved nothing.

### Fixed — line endings were unmentioned and load-bearing

Run artifacts are CRLF and the script reads with `newline=""` to stay
byte-stable, so a `find` string composed with `
` matched nothing at all: a
silent `not_found` on every multi-line correction, for a reason unrelated to the
text. Matching now tries the literal string first and falls back to a
newline-normalised comparison, returning the substring as it actually appears so
the replacement preserves the file's own endings. A genuinely absent string still
fails — the tolerance does not turn a miss into a match.

### Added — two representations that were missing

- **`requires_rework`** — a correction that is neither a substitution nor a
  person's job, such as a section the outline requires and the draft never wrote.
  It carries a `target_phase` naming who must do it. Filing this under
  `requires_human` made the pipeline's own work look like a task waiting on the
  user.
- **`superseded`** — after a loop, Phase 3 rewrites the draft and every `find`
  string is expected to stop matching. Marking the stale rows rather than
  overwriting the ledger keeps "Phase 3 fixed this itself" distinguishable from
  "this was lost", which is the whole point of the ledger.

### Clarified

- **What counts as a correction**, since one rule required every correction to
  reach the ledger and another barred advisory suggestions, with no boundary
  between them: a correction makes the piece wrong or unpublishable if left; an
  improvement does not, however good the idea.
- The validate command is given as an absolute path, and the rules no longer cite
  a report section number the template does not define.

**11 new tests.**

## [3.30.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — the remedy for a stale correction manufactured a false accusation

Phase 5's outcome table said that when a correction reports `not_found`, make it
by hand and set the item to `applied` with a note. But `verify` checks that the
item's `replace` string is present in the body, and a hand-correction phrased
differently leaves `replace` pointing at wording nobody wrote — so the item
verifies as `regressed`, which Phase 8 escalates to "a later phase undid this
correction". A real remediation would have reported five of eleven corrections as
downstream sabotage that never happened. The remedy has to update what `verify`
actually checks.

- **New `fix-ledger.py resolve`** — re-points `replace` at the text actually
  written, preserves Phase 4's wording in `original_replace`, and **refuses when
  the text you claim to have written is not in the file**, so it cannot be used
  to declare a correction done without doing it. Editing the ledger JSON by hand
  is now explicitly wrong.
- **New `already_satisfied` status** — for the case where an earlier phase had
  already made the correction in other words and the edit changed zero bytes.
  Marking that `applied` claims a substitution nobody performed.

### Fixed — "copy this verbatim" with no safe channel

A reviewer copied the ledger payload out of stdout on Windows and silently got
`Â§` for `§` and a mangled em dash — the console codepage, not the script — then
recorded `checks_copied_verbatim: true`. Nothing downstream could have caught it,
which is the exact failure that step exists to prevent. `verify --out FILE` now
writes the payload as UTF-8 bytes, declared in the Pipeline Contract as
`phase-7-fix-ledger.json`, and the reviewer is told to read the file.

### Fixed — three representation gaps

- One Phase 4 issue can carry two find/replace pairs (MOD-2 gave two pronoun
  fixes under one id) while ledger ids must be unique. `source_id` now ties
  `MOD-2a`/`MOD-2b` back to the report the rules require them to match.
- `checkpoint-manager.py finalize` had no status for a run that completed every
  phase, passed its reviewer, and is still not publishable. `blocked` added —
  forcing it into `completed` is the misstatement the Phase 8 gate exists to stop.
- Phase 5's own example named `phase-3.5-visuals.md` as the target, which in a
  run where the annotated draft was never saved is the Visual Asset *Report*.
  Applying publication corrections to a report nobody publishes is a correction
  that did not happen.

**8 new tests.**

## [3.29.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed — the publication gate was undone at the last step

v3.28.0 taught Phase 8 to refuse to call a piece publishable while mandatory
corrections were open. Running that end to end on a real blocked deliverable
showed the delivery step reversing it:

- **`mark_complete` hardcoded `target["status"] = "completed"`.** A deliverable
  the pipeline had just refused to publish could only be filed as finished —
  producing exactly the tracking row the contract calls "how one gets published
  by mistake". Status now comes from `--data`, with `blocked_reason` recorded.
- **Both published copies were named from the tracking row's `title`**, never
  from the source filename, so a `DRAFT-` prefixed document published under an
  ordinary name. Any status other than `completed` now prefixes both copies, so
  the marker follows the recorded status rather than a string someone typed.

### Fixed — a target that exists nowhere in the pipeline

`generate-docx.py` printed `Burstiness score 0.62 (target >=0.7)` into Appendix C
of the client-facing document. Phase 7 scores burstiness as advisory with no
minimum and the completion card says "advisory — no minimum". The delivered
document was showing a figure failing a threshold nobody set.

### Fixed — four contract defects found by running the contracts

- `--brand` was documented as `{brand_name}` where `local-tracker.py` wants the
  slug; it slugifies whatever it gets, so a display name silently creates a
  second brand tree. One run delivered into `Documents\ContentForge\Internet
  Archive\` while its tracking lived under `e2e-preservation`.
- `fix_ledger` was specified as an array in Step 0 and an object in the OUTPUT
  FORMAT schema. Both could not hold; it is an object, with the array at
  `.checks`.
- The Quality Scorecard template had no publication-status line and no ledger row
  in its Gate 7 checklist, so a scorecard rendered faithfully to template read
  APPROVED with nothing indicating the piece was unpublishable.
- `phase_7_review` minimums and `feedback_loop_limits` were cited as top-level
  config keys; both live under `default.`, where a literal top-level lookup
  returns null.
- Phase 8 now states the embedding rule directly: approval gates AI-generated
  imagery, not charts rendered deterministically from Phase 2's verified data.

Reviewer `maxTurns` raised 15 -> 24 to match what its contract mandates.

**8 new tests**, including a plant-check confirming both delivery guards fail
when removed.

## [3.28.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed — production scaffolding reached the reader

A delivered run was audited artifact by artifact. The published article carried
three raw `[VISUAL-PLACEHOLDER: ...]` lines — instructions addressed to Phase 3.5
— visible to the reader, and embedded **none** of the three valid charts sitting
on disk. Phase 3.5 never replaced the placeholders with `<!-- VISUAL: id=... -->`
anchors, so Phase 8 had nowhere to insert the assets. Nothing looked broken: the
charts existed, the manifest validated, the document rendered.

The compounding part: `body_word_count` had been taught (v3.25.0) to exclude
placeholder lines so Gate 3 would measure prose. That was right for the count and
it removed the only thing in the pipeline that touched them. **Excluding something
from a measurement can delete the last signal that it exists.**

- `text-metrics.py` now reports `residual_scaffolding` (count, line numbers, kind)
  and `visual_markers` (anchor ids) in its default result — no flag required, so
  no caller has to know the check exists to receive it.
- Phase 8 gains a second publication gate: `residual_scaffolding.clean` must be
  true and `visual_markers.ids` must cover every manifest asset marked
  `generated`. Failing either blocks the *claim* that the document is ready; the
  document is still produced, and Phase 8 still does not edit the body.
- Phase 3.5 must verify its own replacements before returning.

### Fixed — a deletion could not be expressed in the fix ledger

Phase 4's contract says a CRITICAL hallucination MUST be removed, and
`validate_ledger` rejected an empty `replace` — so the ledger could not carry its
most severe class of correction, and every removal had to be re-phrased as a
rewrite. Removals are now first-class (`"replace": ""`) and verified by absence:
the correction is regressed if the text comes back. Found by a validator agent
working the real contract on a planted draft.

### Fixed — `loop_history` was documented but never written

`utils/loop-tracker.md` documented a history of from_phase, to_phase, iteration,
reason and timestamp, and said it survived `/contentforge:resume`. `record_loop`
wrote counts only, so the reason a run looped lived in the orchestrator's context
and vanished with the session. `loop` now takes `--reason`, appends a persisted
`loop_history` entry, and warns when a reason is omitted.

### Fixed — two Phase 4 contract defects

- **Accuracy Confidence had an undefined denominator.** "Total factual claims
  analyzed" was analyst-chosen, so the figure moved with claim-splitting judgement
  while being checked against fixed bands — the same defect as a word count with
  an unstated convention. The counting rule is now written down and the claims
  must be enumerated so a reader can recount them.
- **Step 6.1 required an artifact the INPUTS never provided.** Outline adherence
  was to be checked against a Verified Outline that was not in the input list;
  `phase-1-research.md` is now declared, with NOT VERIFIABLE as the honest
  fallback rather than inferring the outline from the draft.

**19 new tests.**

## [3.27.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed — Phase 4's corrections had nowhere to go

A completed run was audited against its own artifacts. Phase 4 closed with an
explicit "apply, do not re-argue" fix list carrying exact find/replace strings,
and chose PASS over a loop specifically because those fixes would be carried
forward. **One of eight was applied.** Phase 6.5 later rewrote one of the flagged
sentences and widened the very claim Phase 4 had objected to. Phase 7 recovered
six by grepping the finished article, missed a seventh whose string had drifted,
and recorded them under `mandatory_before_publish` — a field that exists nowhere
in this plugin. Phase 8 delivered the .docx with all of it outstanding.

No agent misbehaved. Three independent contract defects lost the work:

- Phase 4's only documented destination for a fix list was "FEEDBACK FOR PHASE 3
  (CONTENT DRAFTER) — when looping back". On a PASS there was no destination.
- Phase 5's input list described `phase-4-validation.md` as a report with "any
  minor fixes applied", presupposing the work was done.
- Phase 5's Critical Rule forbade changing "facts, statistics, or citations",
  which is exactly what a reference URL, a citation date and a claim-scope
  tightening are. The corrections were unappliable by contract.

**Added `scripts/fix-ledger.py`** and the `phase-4-fixes.json` artifact:

- Phase 4 emits corrections as a machine-readable ledger whenever it carries any
  forward, whatever its decision. Prose is not a handoff.
- Phase 5 applies them verbatim by script (`apply`) before any structural edit,
  with the Critical Rule now carrying a stated exception for the ledger.
- **The authorship record is the guard.** Each substitution is trial-applied and
  reverted if it would rewrite or drop one of the author's own sentences.
- A find-string that no longer matches is reported `not_found` and blocks —
  never treated as "nothing to do". Three of the eight had already drifted, so a
  script that shrugged at a missing match would have reported success having done
  nothing.
- `verify` re-checks survival after every later phase, so applying a fix is not
  the end of its life. Gate 6.5 now fails a humanizer pass that undoes one.
- Phase 7 copies the verify result into `fix_ledger` + `publication_status`
  instead of re-deriving the list by hand.
- Phase 8 enforces it: unresolved blockers do not stop the document being
  produced, they stop it being called ready — `DRAFT-` prefix,
  `publication_blockers` recorded, blocked status in the tracking row.
- `requires_human` items (supply a feature image, render a pending chart) are
  first-class ledger entries: they cannot be auto-applied and still block.

Gates 4, 5, 6.5, 7 and 8 in the Pipeline Contract updated to match.

**28 new tests** (`tests/test_fix_ledger.py`), including plant-checks that each
guard can actually fail, and contract-wiring tests that pin the prose — the
original defect lived entirely in the wording.

## [3.26.0] - 2026-08-15

The recovery path could not see the crash it exists for. Found by crashing a real run.

### Fixed — `resume` was blind to the window it was built for

A self-orchestrated 10-phase run hit a session usage limit mid-Phase 7.
`phase-7-review.json` was already complete on disk (45KB, `overall_score` 8.3,
`decision: APPROVED`) but the checkpoint had not been recorded. **`resume` reported
`next_phase: 7`.** Following that literally would have discarded a finished review and burned
a full reviewer pass, with no guarantee the new score matched.

`get_status` derived `next_phase` from `manifest["completed_phases"]` alone and never scanned
the run directory — so a run crashes in one of two windows, and the second one (artifact
written, checkpoint not recorded) was exactly the one it could not see.

`status` now reports **`orphaned_artifacts`** plus a `reconciliation_note`. `next_phase` keeps
its old meaning so nothing downstream changes silently; the note is what tells a caller the
number is incomplete. The contract's instruction is deliberately two-sided: never re-run a
phase whose work is already on disk, and never checkpoint it unverified either — an unverified
artifact is a claim, not a pass.

### Fixed — checkpointing was not byte-stable on Windows

`read_text` (universal newlines) plus `write_text` (`os.linesep`) rewrote every LF as CRLF.
Checkpointing a 45,087-byte review produced a 45,551-byte file with a different sha256 and no
semantic change. Because a gate FAIL re-saves the looped phase, artifacts churned on every
loop — and a `source_sha256` recorded in `phase-8-output.json` did not match what `sha256sum`
reported for the same file, which defeats the point of recording it. Both sides now use
`newline=""`.

### Fixed — Gate 8 asked for fewer appendices than its own config

The Pipeline Contract said "Appendices A/B/C present" while
`config/scoring-thresholds.json` requires `appendices_present: 4` (A SEO Scorecard, B Quality
Scorecard, C Production Details, D Internal Link Map) — in a file that states the config wins
where they disagree. A Phase 8 emitting three appendices would have passed the documented gate
and failed the configured one.

### Added — a rule for a subagent that goes silent

The run's output-manager completed the .docx, all four delivery copies and the tracking
update, then returned only "Now generating the .docx with the real script." — no report, and
its contracted `phase-8-output.json` unwritten. Re-running it blind would have regenerated
finished work; calling the phase failed would have been false. The contract now says: audit
the disk, verify what exists against the gate, and ask the SAME agent for the missing piece.

### The run itself

All 11 phases completed, **38 of 38 contract checks passed**, Phase 7 approved at 8.3 with
4/4 internal links re-verified live, and a 45,520-byte .docx with all four appendices and zero
embedded images (every visual stayed `approved_by_user: false`, as it should with image
generation never opted into). All 6 of the author's source-draft paragraphs are traceable
verbatim into the delivered document.

Suite: 329 -> 335.

---

## [3.25.0] - 2026-08-15

Found by a full self-orchestrated pipeline run: the plugin driving its own ten phases, with
every gate verified by the orchestrator rather than accepted from the agent reporting it.

### Fixed — `body_word_count` counted production scaffolding

The same Phase 3 draft measured **1,223 body words (PASS)** by the drafter's count and
**1,390 (FAIL)** by an independent audit. Neither reading was careless. The draft carried an
H1, a bold `**Key:** value` metadata block, and three `[VISUAL-PLACEHOLDER: …]` lines
addressed to Phase 3.5 — production instructions that never appear in the published article —
and nothing said whether they counted.

A gate whose verdict depends on an unstated convention is not a measurement. `body_word_count`
now excludes the H1, the metadata block, horizontal rules, HTML comments, placeholder
annotations, and trailing reference/appendix sections, while still counting H2/H3 headings
because those are published text. On the draft in question it returns 1,282 — inside the
window, and between the two hand-counted figures. The counting method is now stated in the
Pipeline Contract so no future drafter has to invent and document one, as this one had to.

### Verified in the wild — the v3.24.0 report-location fix holds

The run was executed by an agent following the shipped instructions, with no help from the
harness. It wrote a 30KB `phase-6.5-report.md` to its own path and left `phase-6.5-humanized.md`
clean, so `authorship.py` measured only the article: **exit 0, 16/16 author sentences verbatim,
0 rewritten, 0 dropped**. Phase 7 approved at **8.3** with all five dimensions above their
minimums. Three gate failures produced three legitimate loops (3.5, 5, 6.5), all within limits.

Suite: 324 -> 329.

---

## [3.24.0] - 2026-08-15

The humanization report stopped corrupting the provenance record it sits next to.

### Fixed — the Humanization Report was written into the file `authorship.py` measures

`authorship.py` classifies **every sentence** in `phase-6.5-humanized.md` to compute
`author_word_share`. The humanizer was told to return "the humanized draft + Humanization
Report" for that one path, so a ~900-word report of the agent's own prose landed inside the
file that decides whether the client may be credited as an author.

This was not theoretical. Five humanizer probes ran against planted fixtures. Two followed
the instruction and embedded the report; two deviated deliberately and flagged the problem
unprompted. **One of the runs that complied produced 104 `ai_added` sentences and
`may_claim_authored: false`** — refusing the author credit for work they had actually done,
on nothing but where a report was written. The two body-only runs landed at
`author_word_share` 0.253 and 0.250, directly on the 0.25 floor, which is why the dilution
was decisive rather than marginal.

The subtle part, and the reason nothing caught it: **`violations` stays clean either way.**
Zero sentences were rewritten and zero dropped in every run. The check designed to catch
authorship problems cannot see this one — only the share moves.

- `phase-6.5-humanized.md` is now **the article body and nothing else**.
- New artifact **`phase-6.5-report.md`** carries the Humanization Report; declared in the
  Pipeline Contract so the orchestrator saves it to its own path.
- Reviewer (Phase 7) and Output Manager (Phase 8) updated to read the report from its new path.
- Three regression tests pin it, including the measured share/verdict flip.

Suite: 317 -> 320.

---

## [3.23.3] - 2026-08-14

Load-test corrections. A verification harness ran every script in the repo plus
an adversarial input battery against the text-processing surface.

### Fixed — the authorship matcher was quadratic

`classify()` compared every source sentence against every draft sentence:
0.47s at 100 sentences, 2.88s at 250, **11.43s at 500**. The difflib prefilter
added earlier pruned almost nothing in the case that actually matters — when the
draft genuinely contains the author's sentences, every pair clears the cheap
bounds. A client's long whitepaper would have hung Phase 6.5.

Rewritten as two passes: a hash index resolves verbatim survivors in linear time
(the overwhelming majority of real matches), and fuzzy comparison runs only over
what is left, gated by a length bound derived from difflib's own ratio formula
(a pair whose lengths differ by more than R/(2-R) cannot reach R). **5000
sentences now match in 0.07s.** Paraphrase detection and the one-to-one
duplicate guard are unchanged and re-verified.

### Verified — 28 adversarial inputs, no crashes

empty, whitespace-only, single character, 50,000 words, one 30,000-word line,
emoji, RTL Hebrew, CJK, malformed frontmatter, unclosed code fence, null bytes,
ANSI control characters, HTML injection, markdown bombs, Windows newlines, no
trailing newline, punctuation-only, 50-level indentation. 1,876 invariant
assertions: every band inside its vocabulary, every metric finite and
non-negative, every flagged span pointing at real text, and the review sheet
escaping injected `<script>`. All pass, and the cases are now regression tests.

### Verified — determinism and exit codes

Identical input produces byte-identical output across five in-process runs and
across four subprocesses with different `PYTHONHASHSEED` values, so no dict or
set iteration order leaks into a result. Exit-code contracts confirmed: 0 clean,
3 on authorship violations, 1 on a missing file.

313 -> 317 tests.

## [3.23.2] - 2026-08-14

Field-test corrections. Five probes were run against the INSTALLED plugin, not
the repo: the humanizer on a planted draft, and both scans against a published
human essay.

### Fixed — the aphorism proxy was marking down good writing

Measured against a published human essay and a real generated article, the
<=9-word aphorism heuristic fired at ~13 per 1000 words on both and drove them
to a HIGH advisory rating — which `agents/07-reviewer.md` maps to a Readability
sub-score of <=5. Good prose was being penalised by a proxy that cannot tell a
maxim from a short factual sentence.

- The heuristic now excludes sentences carrying a personal or anaphoric pronoun,
  or opening with a coordinating conjunction. A maxim generalizes; "The next
  step is to notice them." and "But pick something and get going." depend on
  the sentence before them and are not self-contained claims. Real maxims
  ("Speed wins the shelf.") still flag.
- `aphorism_candidates` no longer contributes to `advisory_rating` at all. A
  signal too imprecise to gate on is too imprecise to drive a rating that feeds
  a score. The count and the flagged sentences are still reported, and pattern
  36 is still enforced by the humanizer's judgment in Step 1.5, where a reading
  can tell the two apart. Result: the human essay dropped HIGH -> MODERATE, the
  AI fixture stayed HIGH.

### Fixed — humanizer turn budget

`maxTurns` 15 -> 22. The field-test humanizer completed the draft and the
authorship record but exhausted its budget before emitting the review sheet;
Step 0.0 and the authorship verification added tool calls the old limit did not
account for. The step now also carries a note on what to drop first if short.

### Field-test result (no change needed)

The author-exemption behaviour passed 10/10 planted traps on the installed
plugin: the author's own "heres the thing" survived verbatim while an AI-added
"Here's the thing - that's the part that really matters" and "Let that sink in"
were deleted; banned lexemes, the soft-adverb cluster and 12 churned entities
were removed; the author's explicitly-unverified claim was left untouched; and
nothing was fabricated. All 5 author sentences verbatim, 0 rewritten, 0 dropped.

310 -> 313 tests.

## [3.23.1] - 2026-08-14

Completes the v3.23.0 self-contradiction fix. Three more places in the
`conversational` personality profile were advising exactly what the humanizer
removes, and shipped a few minutes after the release commit:

- `sentence_patterns` said "Ask rhetorical questions to create dialogue" — the
  rhetorical-Q&A drumroll ("The result? Devastating.") is a reader-facing tell.
  Now: ask the question the reader is genuinely asking, and answer it.
- `techniques` said "Break formality with occasional sentence fragments. Like
  this." — contradicting `sentence_structure_patterns.sentence_fragments` in the
  same file, which allows fragments only where the brand's own `writing_sample`
  uses them (an inserted fragment is pattern 36). Now aligned.
- `example_transforms.after` ended on "Here's how to fix that." — pattern 28
  signposting, in the example held up as the good version. Replaced with a line
  that delivers the point instead of announcing it.

No runtime change; 310 tests unchanged.

## [3.23.0] - 2026-08-14

**The author stays in the piece.** Three capabilities, all built as craft rather than evasion.

### Added — bring your own words (`--source-draft`)

A second intake mode. The author hands over their own rough draft — a voice-note transcript, a wall of bullets, three angry paragraphs typed at midnight — and the pipeline builds the article **around** their sentences instead of over them.

- **`scripts/authorship.py`** — sentence-level provenance between the author's draft and the finished piece. Reports which sentences are theirs verbatim, which were **rewritten**, and which were **dropped**. Matching is greedy best-first and one-to-one, so echoing an author's line cannot inflate their share.
- **Author sentences are protected material.** Phase 3 carries them through verbatim (typos, run-ons, lowercase and all); Phase 6.5 exempts them from the entire 43-pattern catalog — if the author wrote "here's the thing", it stays, because a pattern describes what a model writes unprompted, not what a person chose to say. Grammar-fixing them is forbidden: their clumsiness is the authorship.
- **This check blocks; it does not advise.** Every AI-tell scan in this pipeline stays advisory because a detector score is a probabilistic opinion. "The author wrote this sentence and it is no longer here" is a checkable fact about a promise the pipeline made, so `authorship.py` exits 3 and the reviewer treats it as a BLOCKING finding until the sentence is restored *verbatim* — never resolved by editing their words further.
- **Author claims are not verified facts.** Anything factual the pipeline *adds* still comes from the Phase 2 ledger. A claim of theirs that contradicts the research is flagged for the human editor, never silently corrected.
- **Provenance-accurate disclosure.** When the record earns it, the deliverable's disclosure becomes *"Written by {author} with AI assistance for research, structure, and fact-checking."* It is read off `phase-6.5-authorship.json` and can never be requested: it requires both a 25% author-word floor and zero outstanding violations. The direction is one-way by design — an authorship record may only ever make a disclosure MORE specific about human involvement that demonstrably happened. Overclaiming human authorship is the one form of this statement a reader cannot check.
- No target ratio, and nothing here is aimed at a detector. `author_word_share` exists so the disclosure can be accurate; there is no number at which text becomes "human enough".

### Added — patterns 42 and 43 (catalog: 41 → 43)

- **42 Significance markers (high-signal ×2)** — a sentence whose only job is to tell the reader what a neighbouring sentence means: "here's the thing", "the thing is", "that's the part that got me", "which is exactly the problem", "let that sink in". **Deleted, never reworded** — softening a marker into a gentler marker is not a fix. Distinct from pattern 27 (dresses up an ordinary point) and pattern 28 (announces what comes next rather than grading what came before).
- **43 Soft-adverb feeling tags** — "honestly", "genuinely", "truly", "literally", "actually", "basically", "quietly" attaching feeling instead of meaning, especially sentence-final. Clusters are the tell; one earned use is not, and an absolute floor keeps a single legitimate "actually" in a short piece from normalizing into a false positive.
- Both are machine-detectable via `text-metrics.py --ai-tell-scan` (`significance_marker` / `soft_adverb_cluster` flags, curly apostrophes normalized) and surfaced in the review sheet.

### Fixed — ContentForge was recommending what its humanizer removes

Auditing for pattern 42 surfaced a genuine self-contradiction: three files instructed the drafter to write the exact phrasing Phase 6.5 is supposed to strip.

- `config/humanization-patterns.json` — the `conversational` personality profile told the drafter to "Use 'Here's the thing:' and 'But here's where it gets interesting'", and recommended the rhetorical warm-up "Ever wondered why…?" (pattern 28). The `starting_with_and_or_but` example was "But here's the thing. And that's not all."
- `templates/content-types/blog-structure.md` — the section lead-in "often uses 'Here's the thing…'", the takeaway opener "What this means for you…" / "Bottom line:" (patterns 35 and 42, both counted by the `moralizing` proxy), and tease subheadings "But Wait, There's More" / "Here's Why This Matters".
- `templates/content-types/whitepaper-structure.md` — a "Final Thoughts" conclusion (pattern 35) whose instructions were "Emphasize significance" and "Lasting message", i.e. a direct instruction to write the thing the structural scan measures. The section keeps its genre-appropriate conclusion but now asks for a dated, falsifiable forward statement and the limits of the evidence.
- A new guard fails the suite if any writing-guidance section or content-type template recommends a phrase the catalog removes.

### Added — entity development (structural scan)

- A seventh proxy in `--structure-scan`: text that introduces a fresh name or number in nearly every sentence, each mentioned once and abandoned, reads as a machine *establishing a setting*; an expert returns to the few specifics the argument rests on.
- **Fixed by developing, never by deleting.** The remedy is a second substantive mention of an existing specific from the verified ledger. Cutting specifics to move this number would lower the more important `specificity` finding and inverts the pipeline's purpose; inventing a mention is forbidden outright. Both the script's `meaning` field and the humanizer step say so explicitly.
- Stays silent below 600 words or 12 distinct entities (`measurable: false`) — a short piece names things once for lack of room, which is brevity, not a tell. Calibrated against real fixtures: 1.0 mentions-per-entity on churning text, 2.64 on well-developed prose, with bands at 1.25 / 1.60.
- Thresholds live in-script, deliberately never in `scoring-thresholds.json` — guard-tested, same rule as the rest of the structural tier.

### Notes

- **No watermark detection or removal exists anywhere in ContentForge, and none will be added.** These scans measure visible text only. A guard now fails the suite if evasion vocabulary (zero-width characters, homoglyphs, watermark stripping, "pass as human") appears in any of the files this release touched.
- 273 → **310 tests**. New: `tests/test_authorship_and_markers.py` (37).

## [3.22.0] — 2026-08-13

Honest provenance + the structural tier. Two 2026 realities landed the same
week: Anthropic began statistically watermarking Claude text output (models
launched ≥ 2026-08-02, all surfaces, no opt-out — a mark proves *processed
by*, not *authored by*), and the StoryScope paper (arXiv 2604.03136) showed
AI text stays detectable on document STRUCTURE even after a perfect
surface-style pass (93.9% F1 after stylistic stripping — structure is
"largely orthogonal to surface prose artifacts"). ContentForge's answer to
both is transparency and genuine human shaping, never evasion: no watermark
detection or removal exists in this plugin, permanently.

### Added

- **AI-assistance disclosure layer** (`agents/08-output-manager.md` Step 1.5,
  `scripts/detect_surface.py`, `skills/cf-style-guide` Step 6): brand
  profile gains `ai_disclosure` — `{"mode": "claude-surfaces"|"always"|"off",
  "text": null|custom, "author": null|name}`. Default wording is
  author-optional ("reviewed by our editorial team"), vendor-neutral
  (guard-tested: no model or vendor names), and claims only the review the
  pipeline actually performs. `detect_surface.py` classifies the harness
  from affirmative env fingerprints with the fail-safe pinned in tests:
  **uncertain ⇒ disclose** — skipping requires an affirmative non-Claude
  fingerprint, never mere absence of a Claude one. The block is applied
  inside the deliverable body (survives `/contentforge:publish` and the
  .docx export) and the decision is recorded in `run.json` either way.
- **Tier-2 structural scan** (`text-metrics.py --structure-scan`):
  deterministic proxies for the StoryScope structural tells, adapted to
  non-fiction — moralizing/over-explained takeaways, template section
  symmetry, parallel heading syntax, specificity density (numbers, proper
  nouns, citations, quotes per 1000 words), stance absence (hedging vs
  first-person markers), paragraph-rhythm evenness. Every finding carries
  its spans and an OK/NOTE/ATTENTION band; thresholds live in the script,
  deliberately never in scoring-thresholds.json (advisory-not-gate is
  guard-tested). Tier-1 `--ai-tell-scan` also gains span coverage for
  connective openers and banned-lexeme clusters.
- **Two-tier review sheet** (`scripts/build_review_sheet.py` →
  `phase-6.5-review-sheet.html`): self-contained HTML with Tier-1 sentence
  highlights inline in the draft and Tier-2 structural cards with evidence
  and edit direction. The humanizer emits it (new Step 7.5.4b); the reviewer
  guarantees it exists in every lane (generating it itself when a lane
  skipped Phase 6.5); the Completion Card carries a structural-tells line.
  The sheet's header states the contract: advisory, never a publish gate,
  and it cannot see and has no relationship to any statistical watermark.
- **Structural-edit guidance in the humanizer**: where the scan reports
  NOTE/ATTENTION, apply structural edits grounded in the Phase 2 ledger —
  cut spelled-out takeaways, break template symmetry the content doesn't
  earn, add specific named/numbered facts (never invented), let the brand
  take a research-supported stance.
- `references/ai-detection-signals.md` gains "The structural tier — style is
  not enough" documenting the StoryScope findings and the four transferable
  structural tells. Design spec committed at
  `research/2026-08-13-disclosure-provenance-design.md`.
- `tests/test_disclosure_layer.py` (12 tests) + `tests/test_structural_tells.py`
  (13 tests): the mode×surface decision matrix incl. the uncertain⇒disclose
  pin, default-wording vendor-neutrality, author-optionality, run.json
  recording, AI-shaped fixture fires ATTENTION on all five core tells /
  human-shaped fixture stays OK (plant-checked both directions), review-sheet
  escaping + both-tier content, and the full pipeline wiring. **Tests 248 → 273.**

## [3.21.1] — 2026-08-12

Express keeps the craft. User review of the v3.21.0 express design surfaced the
right objection: the humanizer is not polish — nobody wants AI-sounding prose,
express or not — and the structure/proofread pass carries content-type
structure and zero-typo guarantees that are equally not ceremony. Express's
speed comes from intake replacing Phase 1's deep research hunt, which
dominates full-pipeline wall-clock, so the craft passes cost little and the
default now keeps them.

### Changed

- **Express default phase set** (`skills/contentforge/SKILL.md`): now
  0.5 → 1-INTAKE → 2 → 3 → 4 → **5 Structure (Gate 5 in full)** →
  **6.5 Humanizer (Gate 6.5 in full)** → 7 → 8. Default skips are only
  Phase 3.5 visuals and Phase 6 SEO — the two phases whose value depends on
  surfaces outside the prose — each re-addable via `--with-visuals` /
  `--with-seo` with their full gates. The craft passes drop only on explicit
  `--skip-structure` / `--skip-humanizer`, recorded in `skipped_phases` like
  any other chosen skip.
- In express without Phase 6, the humanizer reads the latest artifact
  (`phase-5-structured.md`, or `phase-3-draft.md` if structure was skipped);
  its GEO-structure- and keyword-preservation checks apply only when SEO ran.
- **Reviewer EXPRESS RUNS** (`agents/07-reviewer.md`): default-skip list
  updated to "only 3.5 visuals and 6 SEO"; the chosen-skip exemption and
  lane-independent hard fails are unchanged.

### Added

- `tests/test_express_lane.py::test_craft_passes_run_by_default`: pins both
  craft agents in the express phase set, the "Runs by default — Gate N in
  full" contract lines, both opt-out flags, and orchestrator/reviewer
  agreement on the default-skip list. A future edit that quietly drops the
  humanizer from express fails the build. **Tests 247 → 248.**



The Express Lane, battle-tested — plus the routing layer, the rename kit, and
the vendor pin. The heaviest pipeline in the suite gains a calibrated second
lane, and the machinery that justifies both lanes was proven by execution, not
by reading.

### Added

- **Express Lane** (`skills/contentforge/SKILL.md`): for users who bring their
  own research ("express", "I have my own sources", `--express`). Phase 1
  becomes source INTAKE — the researcher catalogs and reliability-rates ONLY
  what was provided (Gate 1-E: every source carries a URL or is labeled
  user-provided/unverifiable). Gates 2 (fact-check) and 4 (draft-vs-ledger
  validation) run UNCHANGED — the user's sources get the same verification as
  found sources. Polish phases (3.5 visuals, 5 structure, 6 SEO, 6.5
  humanizer) are skipped by default and individually re-addable
  (`--with-visuals` / `--with-structure` / `--with-seo` / `--with-humanizer`);
  a re-added phase brings its full gate — there is no gate-less phase in any
  lane. `run.json` records `"mode": "express"` + `skipped_phases`.
- **Reviewer express contract** (`agents/07-reviewer.md` § EXPRESS RUNS):
  chosen skips are not defects — no missing-report caps for intentionally
  skipped phases (the battle-test showed the caps would otherwise HALT every
  express run); SEO dimension N/A with weight renormalization unless Phase 6
  ran; skipped-phase qualities scored from the piece itself; missing Phase 2/4
  artifacts remain defects in EVERY lane; hard fails (dead links,
  hallucinations, prohibited claims) are lane-independent.
- **Execution battle-test of the quality machinery** — three probes run
  against the INSTALLED plugin's agents with planted defects, all passed:
  fact-checker caught a fabricated enforcement date, traced a garbled "94%"
  statistic to the real TrustRadius study it was mangled from, and corrected a
  misquoted vendor figure; reviewer fired the dead-internal-link hard fail
  (HALT), refused to loop with `run.json` absent, and capped honestly for
  missing artifacts; humanizer delivered a 24-cut Deletion Ledger with pattern
  ids, machine-verified metric drops (banned lexemes 38.9→0/1000), and
  invented nothing in cut-don't-ground mode. Two probes independently caught
  the same LIVE source drift (a cited vendor page now claims 5-10% where the
  research recorded 5-15%) — the verification thesis working on real-world
  rot, unprompted.
- **All 22 skill descriptions rewritten trigger-dense** (median ~770 chars;
  20 of 22 were one-liners under 161 chars): does/produces → "Triggers on"
  with ≥4 real user phrases (`/contentforge:<name>` alias first) →
  reads/pairs-with, each written against the full SKILL.md with capabilities
  not delivered deliberately unclaimed. Guarded by
  `tests/test_description_density.py` (floors + median).
- **Rename-readiness kit** (`scripts/rename_readiness.py` +
  `tests/test_rename_readiness.py`): the plugin's ~1,500 name occurrences
  classified by ROLE (manifest identity, namespace refs, skill-prefix refs,
  repo URLs, prose), invariants that keep a rename mechanical (no variant
  spellings — needle assembled at runtime; manifests parseable and canonical),
  and `--plan --new-name X` emits the ordered 7-step rename plan (manifests →
  namespaces → dirs → URLs → prose → marketplace/cache-purge → full-suite
  verify). Read-only by test-enforced contract, and it suggests no names.
- **Vendor-neutrality guard** (`tests/test_vendor_neutrality.py`): the 2026-08
  audit found the instruction surface already clean — these tests pin it: no
  sign-up/install instructions for commercial products, vendor mentions must
  carry conditional/connected framing (catalog skills exempt by name), no bare
  model ids outside the resolver. Three bare-vendor lines found by the scanner
  were reframed (cf-audit, cf-brief, cf-translate).

### Fixed

- **README release-notes label**: the 2026-08-09 documentation release was
  narrated as "v3.20.0" — it was v3.19.3; history restored, and the real
  v3.19.4–v3.20.0 releases added to the notes.

Suite: **224 → 247**.

---

## [3.20.0] — 2026-08-12

Video scripts pass the same quality machinery as articles. cf-video-script ran
its own mini-pipeline — research, draft, structure — but stopped there: no
fact-check, no humanization, no review score. A statistic spoken in a voiceover
is the same liability as one printed in an article; worse, a published article
can be corrected in place and a rendered, posted video cannot.

### Added

- **Phase 3.5 — Claim Verification.** `contentforge:fact-checker` runs on the
  drafted script's narration and on-screen text; every claim is checked against
  the Phase 1 research, unverifiable numbers are rewritten to what the evidence
  supports or cut, and "studies show" with no study is removed, not softened.
  Quality gate: zero unverified claims. This gate is why cf-video-script is a
  ContentForge skill and not a prompt.
- **Spoken-language pass in Phase 4.** Voiceover is read aloud, so narration is
  humanized for the ear: contractions, short sentences, no written-prose
  constructions, and the humanizer catalog's filler/hedging and signposting
  patterns applied to dialogue — "Let's dive in" dies here too.
- **Phase 4.5 — Review Scorecard.** Five dimensions scored 1-10 (hook, claim
  integrity, payoff density, retention risk, CTA), pass at ≥7.0 average with no
  dimension below 6 — the same discipline as the main pipeline's reviewer. A
  failing script goes back to the failing phase, not out the door, and the
  scorecard ships in the output document: an unscored script is an unreviewed
  script.

---

## [3.19.5] — 2026-08-12

### Changed

- **cf-video-script: the payoff rule and retention notes** (3min+ profiles),
  extracted from the same reference study as 3.19.4. Time allocation already
  said how long each scene runs; the payoff rule says what it must have
  delivered by the time it ends — no scene ends on setup, because a scene that
  only sets up the next one is where viewers leave. Scripts now ship with
  retention notes naming the 2-3 likely drop points (the setup stretch, the
  mid-video sag, the pre-CTA fade) and the specific hold at each. Both are
  enforced in the Phase 2 quality gate: a script with no identified risk
  points has not been read as a viewer.

---

## [3.19.4] — 2026-08-12

Three craft upgrades to the writing agents, extracted from a study of 17
third-party creator skills — patterns taken as reference and reimplemented
fresh against ContentForge's own pipeline, nothing copied.

### Changed

- **Humanizer (6.5): the Deletion Ledger.** Deletion is now first-class, not a
  fallback — when a sentence carries no information, it is deleted rather than
  rewritten into different filler of the same length. The Humanization Report
  gains an editor-facing cut list: every phrase removed outright, quoted
  verbatim with its pattern id and the reason. A rewrite can only be judged by
  re-reading the whole piece; a cut list can be audited in seconds, and it
  teaches the client's own writers what to stop typing.
- **Drafter (3): open with the climax.** The intro no longer starts from a
  menu of generic hook types. The drafter scans the Phase 2 verified-claims
  ledger for the single most surprising finding — the thing a reader would
  quote to a colleague — and leads with it, bridging back to context second.
  Manufactured urgency, scene-setting generalities, dictionary definitions and
  "in this article we'll explore" are named as banned openers. The climax must
  be a verified Phase 2 claim, so the strongest opener and the hallucination
  guard are the same rule.
- **Reviewer (7): the unanswered-questions check.** Every review now reads the
  piece from the persona's seat and names the top 3 questions the reader is
  left silently asking — the one omission every other rubric dimension misses,
  because they all look at what the content says rather than what it skips.
  Each question gets a disposition: PATCH (fix in place — all-PATCH caps Depth
  at 6 until fixed), FAQ (feeds the FAQ block), or FOLLOW-UP (a logged
  calendar candidate with a validated angle).
- **cf-aeo-check** folds the reviewer's FAQ-disposition questions into its
  probe queries — the questions readers are left asking are the closest thing
  to real query data the pipeline produces, and exactly what answer engines
  get asked.

---

## [3.19.3] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Documentation caught up with the repo.** `TESTING-GUIDE.md` had drifted to roughly the v3.8.0 state: it told reviewers to expect 19 skills and 7 commands (actual: 22 and 9), so a correct install "failed" the checklist. Section 2.3 tested a `SessionStart` hook and a `setup.py` that were both removed in v3.9.0, section 2.4 listed file counts that no longer matched any directory, and section 8 tested a hook set that ships empty by design — that section now verifies the intended silence instead, and points at the Phase 2.5 validator and Phase 7 reviewer where those checks actually run. `SUBMISSION.md` corrected (19→22 skills, 7→9 commands, and 16→10 industry knowledge packs — there are 10 packs in `config/industries/`). `COWORK-GUIDE.md` skill total corrected. One dead config reference in the testing guide repointed at `scoring-thresholds.json` (`default.word_counts`), which is where per-content-type word counts actually live.
- **`cf-help` anti-pattern list no longer cites stale numbers** — its "do not quote counts from this file body" example used literal figures that had themselves gone out of date; now phrased generically.

### Added
- **`tests/test_doc_counts.py`** — live documentation may not advertise stale skill / agent / command counts. Ground truth is derived from the filesystem, so the only way to pass is to fix the prose. Historical release entries keep their ship-time numbers: a bold dated version tag opens a historical block that runs to the next `##` heading, and files banner-marked `HISTORICAL DOCUMENT` are skipped entirely, as are ranges (`3-5 skills`) and sentences about a sibling plugin. Plant-check verified. Mirrored into Digital Marketing Pro and SocialForge.
- **Sponsorship wiring** — `.github/FUNDING.yml` (so the Sponsor button renders), a sponsor section and badge in the README, and `SPONSORS.md`.

---

## [3.19.2] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- **`tests/test_skill_references.py` — the per-skill `references/` contract is now machine-enforced.** The v3.19.1 refactor made 24 section-scoped pointers the only route to the relocated examples, transcripts, and troubleshooting, and nothing verified they still led anywhere. Five guards: every `references/*.md` pointer resolves to a real file; every cited `section "…"` matches a real heading in that file; no reference file goes uncited; every pointer carries the `(in this skill's directory)` disambiguator that separates a skill's own `references/` from the plugin root's; and no run of content lines is duplicated between a skill body and its own reference. Each guard was verified to fire against a planted defect.

### Fixed
- **De-duplicated the manual-input prompt list** in `cf-style-guide`. v3.19.1 inlined the 7-item sequence back into the skill body (it carries the E-E-A-T authorless opt-out that Step 5 depends on) but left a verbatim copy in `references/cli-usage-examples.md` — two sources of truth, identical at ship time and free to drift on the next edit. The body copy is canonical; the reference now points at it. The new duplication guard keeps the pair from re-forming.

---

## [3.19.1] — 2026-08-07

### Changed
- **Advisory-era coherence sweep** — `utilities/translation-manager.md`'s `burstiness_score` field comment and `utilities/analytics-tracker.md`'s synthetic insight/recommendation no longer imply a 0.7 burstiness target; both now describe burstiness as advisory-only, matching the v3.19.0 humanizer contract.
- **Context-efficiency refactor** — the five largest SKILL.md bodies (`cf-style-guide` 840, `cf-social-adapt` 650, `cf-brief` 625, `contentforge` 554, `cf-analytics` 516 lines) slimmed to ≤500 lines per Agent Skills guidance; verbatim example transcripts, JSON templates, CLI usage examples, and troubleshooting prose moved into 10 new per-skill `references/` files with 24 section-scoped "read this before doing that" pointers at each excision point. Step sequences, quality-gate criteria, Task/subagent_type dispatch instructions, and the Completion Card block stay in the body verbatim — zero content loss, verified byte-level in both directions; orchestrator gates/contract/Card untouched.

### Fixed
- **Dead config key removed** — `min_sentence_variety_score` in `config/scoring-thresholds.json`'s `phase_6_5_humanizer` block was orphaned since burstiness went advisory-only in v3.19.0; removed.
- **Test regex hardening** — the `DATED_LINE` guard in `tests/test_pipeline_graph.py` (exempts historical "**vX.Y.Z" prose from live-claim scans) now matches patch versions (`\d+\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?`), not just `major.minor`.
- **Two new guard tests** — `test_link_counting.py` pins that markdown image syntax (`![alt](url)`) is excluded from internal-link counting; `test_client_site_graph.py` pins that the AI-detectability advisory rating stays wired end to end (reviewer scorecard → Completion Card → Phase 6.5 tell-scan).

Tests 215 → **217**.

## [3.19.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added — Client-Site Intelligence
- **`scripts/harvest-brand-pages.py`** — stdlib, robots-respecting site crawler; brand-setup now auto-harvests `brand_pages` (service/conversion/authority pages, HTTP-verified) and verbatim `brand_facts` (one source URL per fact, inconsistencies flagged for human confirmation) with a single confirmation step. `harvest_status` records declined/failed/no-website honestly.
- **Phase 1 Client Site Reconnaissance** — the researcher now researches the client first: brand facts from the brand's own pages + a verified Internal-Link Inventory (topic, deep URL, suggested anchor, live-check date). Gate 1 requires ≥3 verified deep brand URLs when the brand has a website.
- **Source hierarchy** — primary regulatory > peer-reviewed > government > tier-1 industry > vendor; regulatory claims MUST cite the primary document or carry `NEEDS-PRIMARY-SOURCE`.
- **Phase 6 thin-brand_pages guard** — empty/homepage-only `brand_pages` no longer skips commercial linking: falls back to the Phase 1 inventory, then just-in-time sitemap fetch. Deep-link rule (≥2 deep links when the site has them) + native-section placement + live-URL hard rule.
- **`references/ai-detection-signals.md`** — the internalized detector knowledge base: what detectors measure (perplexity, burstiness, stylometrics, watermarking), why grounding beats tricks, and the two hard guardrails (never optimize to a detector; never trade a fact for style).
- **Patterns 36–41 (catalog 35 → 41)** — aphoristic maxims, impersonal assertion, epistemic flatness, perfect parallelism, participial openers, connective-opener density — plus `human_grounding_techniques`, the positive model (journalistic grounding, technical-broad balance, factual clarity, calibrated expert voice, content-derived variation).
- **`text-metrics.py --ai-tell-scan`** — deterministic detector-signal proxies (aphorism density, banned lexemes, connective/participial openers, uniform runs) with an advisory LOW/MODERATE/HIGH rating surfaced in the reviewer scorecard, the Completion Card, and the .docx Quality Appendix. Advisory end to end — never a publish gate. Works identically on every platform with zero external dependencies; an external detector reachable via MCP is used for at most one optional validation pass.

### Changed
- **Humanizer** — "insert short punchy sentences to raise burstiness" is REMOVED (it manufactured the exact aphorism tell modern detectors flag). Replaced by a Human-Expert Grounding Pass (specifics from the verified ledger only) and content-derived variation. Burstiness is now advisory, not a gate.
- **Reviewer** — internal-link free passes removed: a brand WITH a website but unharvested `brand_pages` is a scored deficiency (was N/A); homepage-only linking caps the sub-score at 4 with a mandatory finding; any dead internal-link URL is a hard publish-blocking FAIL. Sentence-variety rubric now scores manufactured variety BELOW uniformity.
- **Completion Card** — surfaces internal-link deficiencies, the advisory AI-detectability rating, and visual-element human-review flags.

### Fixed
- **Cowork misdetection** — layered environment detection (proxy env vars, mitm socket, /sessions root, container markers) with an uncertain-tier warning; the sandbox file-write warning now actually fires in Cowork.
- **Link telemetry** — `generate-docx.py` now counts BOTH link pathways (markers + inline markdown links, split internal/outbound by brand domain); `internal_links_total: 0` alongside rendered hyperlinks can no longer happen.

Tests 173 → **215**.

## [3.18.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Source-anonymity guard test added** (`tests/test_source_anonymity.py`) — the suite-wide rule that the methodology's source organization is never named in the repo is now machine-enforced on every run (forbidden strings assembled at runtime; verified to fire on a planted needle). Tests 172 → **173**.
## [3.18.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Documentation sweep + functional verification of the new types

- **User docs brought current with v3.18.0** — they had drifted badly: the README skills table still listed 19 skills (missing `cf-cowork-setup`, `cf-environment` and the new `cf-aeo-check`), advertised parallel batch in three places (including an FAQ answering "Yes — 4-5× speedup" — the queue is sequential and checkpointed by design), and told users there were 5 built-in content types when 8 ship. AGENTS.md said "19 skills" and its surfaces line was stuck at v3.13.0. USER-GUIDE was titled v3.16.1 with 5-type enumerations. All corrected; USER-GUIDE now opens with a What's-new note and both agent-surface docs route case studies, newsletters and cf-aeo-check.
- **Two more regex-bump casualties repaired**: the README's version-history entry for the 2026-07-12 self-containment patch had been silently relabeled **v3.18.0** by successive blanket version replaces — restored to **v3.16.1**, with real entries added for v3.17.x (the audit series) and v3.18.0. Release bumps in this repo now never blanket-replace version strings in the README.
- **New types verified by execution, not just review**: `checkpoint-manager.py init` records `case_study`/`newsletter` runs; `pipeline-tracker.py` benchmarks resolve for both; `generate-docx.py` produced real .docx files for each with the author byline rendered, the type label on the title page, and `{{unsubscribe_link}}` + client-attested qualifiers surviving conversion; `local-tracker.py` round-trips a `case_study` record to completed.
- Guards extended to user docs: the parallel-claims scan now covers README/AGENTS/guides (it immediately caught the agents-table row and the FAQ), the README skills table must list every shipped skill directory, and README/AGENTS/USER-GUIDE must mention every registered content type. Tests 170 → **172**.

## [3.18.0] — 2026-07-30

### Added — Four capabilities, wired the ContentForge way

Every addition registers in the full interconnection graph (all enumerations, gates, tests) — nothing ships half-wired.

- **Author / E-E-A-T byline layer.** The pipeline scored *competitors* on named authors with credentials while producing authorless content itself (`cf-publish` literally previewed "Author: ContentForge"). New `author_profiles` block in the brand profile (sample + instructions in `config/brand-registry-template.json`); `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` captures authors at import or prompts for one; Phase 3 resolves the byline (`--author` → type match → default → authorless) and stamps it in the skeleton + Draft Metadata; Phase 6 emits **Person JSON-LD** from profile fields only — never fabricated — and flags authorless runs in the SEO Scorecard; `cf-brief` recommends the byline author by expertise match. Authorless remains a legitimate, explicitly-recorded choice.
- **Case Study — 7th built-in content type.** `templates/content-types/case-study-structure.md` with the **Data Provenance rule** the type lives or dies on: client-attested facts (intake-supplied, marked CLIENT-ATTESTED, internal-consistency-checked, approval-tracked) vs external context facts (normal Phase 2 verification). Fabricating a client, metric, or quote is a pipeline HALT, not a loop. Required intake, executive-snapshot metrics table (structure-manifest-protected for AI liftability), honest-friction requirement, and per-phase adaptations.
- **Newsletter — 8th built-in content type.** `templates/content-types/newsletter-structure.md` with a Phase 6 mapping table so email runs the same gates without special-casing the orchestrator (subject line ≐ meta title, preview text ≐ meta description, schema N/A-neutral). Subject-line package with a real A/B variable, one-CTA rule, skim test, named sender from `author_profiles`, 600px/inline-CSS/plain-text constraints, and the same AI-disclosure rule as `cf-publish`.
- **`/contentforge:cf-aeo-check` — 22nd skill.** Post-publication AI-citation check that closes the loop `cf-brief` opens: per-query AI Overview + own-citation probe, on-page extractability audit (definition block, dates, structure survival, schema stripped by CMS, byline rendered), append-only history at `{brand}/aeo/checks.json` with deltas, and evidence-based routing to `/contentforge:content-refresh`. Brutally honest scope: Google-observable signals only unless an AEO-tracking connector is present — "Never present an estimate as a measurement."
- **Both types registered in all 25 enumeration sites** — orchestrator spec table (with gate targets), batch validation, calendar validation, analytics filters + schema, cf-template lists (its custom-template walkthrough now uses product-comparison, since case-study went built-in), cf-brief, drafter template list, output-manager folder mapping, both commands docs, script help texts, pipeline-tracker benchmarks, and brand-registry word counts + tone map. Also closed the same-class stragglers for `video_script` (commands docs, tracker benchmarks, brand-registry) found during registration.
- Graph tests extended: generic 3-spelling registry check across 13 enumeration files, per-type tracker benchmarks, the author layer end-to-end, and cf-aeo-check's honesty contract + routing. Tests 162 → **170**.

## [3.17.5] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Quality audit pass (every agent and skill judged on methodology, not just contracts)

- **`cf-brief` contradicted the Phase 6 optimizer on llms.txt.** The optimizer correctly states llms.txt is an unadopted community proposal Google has publicly said it does not use; the brief called it "the emerging convention" and recommended adding pieces to it. A brief and an optimizer giving opposite guidance on the same question is a coin-flip for the model executing them. The brief now carries the same honest stance: optional housekeeping if the domain already maintains one, never an AI-visibility tactic.
- Quality verdicts recorded for all 13 agents and 21 skills (see release notes): methodology is current — placements-over-density SEO, the 35-pattern humanizer with structural 2026 tells and self-critique pass, measured gates from config, honest connector/parallelism claims. Identified upgrade candidates (author/E-E-A-T byline layer, case-study content type, newsletter content type, post-publication AI-citation check) are product-scope additions awaiting a go decision, not defects.

## [3.17.4] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Completing the cross-file read (every skill and agent)

Finished reading all 13 agents and all 21 skills end-to-end against the interconnection graph. Four more systemic breaks, each invisible in any single file:

- **`video_script` was a shipped content type the system did not know about.** `templates/content-types/video-script-structure.md` ships, `03-content-drafter` loads it, and `cf-video-script` produces it — but **eight** enumerations listed only five types. `09-batch-orchestrator` rejected a `video_script` row as an invalid content type, `cf-calendar` rejected it in validation, `cf-analytics` could not filter for it, `cf-style-guide` left it out of `content_types_supported`, and the orchestrator's **Content Types & Specifications table had no row for it at all** — so Gate 3 (word count ±10%) and Gate 5 (readability ±0.5 grade) had no target to check video scripts against. Added everywhere, with the duration-driven rule Gate 3 must use instead of the article word-count rule.
- **Twelve skills advertised batch processing as parallel.** `09-batch-orchestrator` states plainly: *"No concurrency. Do not claim or attempt parallel pipelines."* Yet `cf-analytics`, `cf-brief` (×2), `cf-calendar`, `cf-connect` (×2), `cf-help`, `cf-integrations`, `cf-publish`, `cf-social-adapt`, `cf-variants` and `content-refresh` all promised parallel production. Every one now describes the sequential, checkpointed queue that actually runs.
- **`cf-video-script` offered a 15-second length with no template profile.** The skill lists `15s` as a supported length and budgets 30-38 words for it, but the template declared only 30s/60s/3min/5min/10min. Added the 15s profile (hook / main point / CTA-loop) so Shorts and Reels scripts have a structure to follow.
- **`08-output-manager` double-prefixed an absolute path.** It read chart PNGs from `~/.claude-marketing/{brand-slug}/assets/{file_path}` while `file_path` in the visual manifest is already absolute per the ONE PATH RULE — concatenating produced a path that cannot exist, silently dropping every generated chart from the .docx. It also had no Drive folder mapping for Video Script.
- **`cf-publish`**: a September schedule date rendered as "March 1, 2026"; HTML exports written to a relative `.tmp/` path instead of the brand output directory; and the "do not use" list named `<5.0` when the actual publish gate is `<7.0` (5.0-6.9 is `review_required`, not publishable).
- `tests/test_pipeline_graph.py` grew guards for the content-type registry (every shipped template must appear in every enumeration and have a spec-table row) and for parallel-batch claims. Tests 158 → **162**.

Verified clean across all 34 files in the same pass: no hardcoded model ids, no claims of active hooks or pre-connected MCP servers, no absolute ranking guarantees, complete frontmatter on every skill, and every relative documentation link resolves.

## [3.17.3] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Cross-file contract review (the pipeline as a graph, not a pile of files)

Extracted ContentForge's actual interconnection graph — who writes each run artifact, who reads it, which skill dispatches which agent, which config key each gate cites — across all 34 skills and agents, then diffed it. The defects live in the edges:

- **Three shipped agents were never dispatched.** The main orchestrator calls every pipeline phase with `Task` + a qualified `subagent_type` (`contentforge:researcher`, etc.). But `cf-social-adapt`, `cf-translate` and `batch-process` only *described* their agents in prose — "The Social Adapter Agent (`agents/10-social-adapter.md`) identifies 10-15 moments" — without ever naming a `subagent_type`. So `10-social-adapter`, `11-translator` and `09-batch-orchestrator` (903 lines of extraction rules, platform formatting, hashtag tiers, localization levels, citation preservation, queue traversal, retry and escalation policy) shipped as registered agents that nothing invoked, while each skill inlined its own drifting copy of the logic. All three now dispatch explicitly, with the same "pass paths, never inline the draft" contract the orchestrator uses.
- **`cf-template` advertised 5 built-in templates; 6 ship.** `video-script-structure.md` was missing from the list in four places, even though `03-content-drafter` actively loads it for video-script content. Users asking for a video-script template were told to build one that already exists.
- New `tests/test_pipeline_graph.py` locks the graph itself: every shipped agent must have a declared dispatcher skill that names it as a `subagent_type`; the three non-orchestrator dispatchers must say `Task`/`subagent_type` rather than prose; no agent may read a run artifact the orchestrator's Pipeline Contract does not produce; the built-in template count and every template name must match `templates/content-types/` on disk; and every config key an agent cites (loop limits, phase-7 minimums, industry packs, per-platform `ai_disclosure`) must resolve. All four fixes above fail these tests on the previous commit.
- Tests 149 → **158**.

## [3.17.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Agent currency and contract review

Re-read the pipeline agents against their config contracts and against current market data:

- **Stale AI-search market data in `06-seo-geo-optimizer`.** The GEO "market reality check" quoted Seer Interactive (Sept 2025) for AI Overview coverage and a mid-2025 ChatGPT MAU figure. Replaced with verified 2026 figures: **~68% of Google searches now end without a click** (Similarweb via Search Engine Land, early 2026; ~83% on AI-Overview queries vs ~60% without), and **ChatGPT at 900M weekly actives** (OpenAI, February 2026). The AI-Overview trigger rate is now expressed as a sourced range (~20-48% depending on query set) rather than a single "% of all searches" figure, because 2026 trackers disagree sharply on methodology.
- **`02-fact-checker` worked example contradicted its own rule.** Step 2.2 makes a single-sourced KEY statistic gate-blocking, with a narrow exception only for reliability-9+ primary sources. The sample scorecard nonetheless marked a key claim (the 68% cost reduction carrying the content angle) ✅ VERIFIED on one industry report — teaching the model to do what the rule forbids. The example now shows it corroborated before PASS.
- **`03.5-visual-asset-annotator` chart script ignored the storage resolver.** The matplotlib block hardcoded `Path.home() / ".claude-marketing"`, while every script resolves storage through `_common.marketing_home()` (`$CLAUDE_MARKETING_HOME` → `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` → `~/.claude-marketing`). With either variable set, charts saved outside the run's brand directory and Phase 8 could not embed them. The block now mirrors the resolver exactly.
- **`04-scientific-validator` had no budget for the 4→3.5 edge.** It documented only `phase_4_to_3: 2` while also being able to loop to Phase 3.5 on a visual-data mismatch, whose limit is `phase_4_to_3_5: 1`. Both edges and the `max_total_loops: 5` ceiling are now stated.

Verified clean in the same pass: no hardcoded model ids anywhere in skills or agents (all resolve through the registry), every `config/` key cited by an agent resolves with the expected value (scoring thresholds, loop limits, industry overrides, the 35-pattern humanizer catalog, all 8 social platform specs with `ai_disclosure`), and every referenced script exists.

## [3.17.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Functional testing pass

Every script was executed end-to-end against real inputs (not just unit-tested), which surfaced defects the 145-test suite could not see:

- **Untitled records published a hidden, self-overwriting file.** `local-tracker.py mark-complete` built the output filename from `slugify(target.get("title", row_id))`, but `add_row` always writes a `title` key (defaulting to `""`), so the `row_id` fallback could never fire. An untitled record published the finished deliverable as a bare `.md` — a dotfile that is hidden on macOS and Linux — and every subsequent untitled record silently overwrote it. The slug now falls through title → requirement id → `untitled`.
- **Dead command references in shipped runtime files.** `scripts/local-tracker.py` and `config/brand-registry-template.json` still pointed at `/contentforge:analytics`, `/contentforge:audit` and `/contentforge:switch-backend`; the shipped skills are `cf-`-prefixed. Corrected.
- Tests 145 → **149**: new `test_local_tracker_publish.py` covers untitled records, collision between two untitled records, punctuation-only titles, and the normal titled path.

## [3.17.0] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — The Line-by-Line Audit

Every file in the repo (147 files, ~45K lines — all 21 skills, 13 agents, 9 commands, 17 scripts, every config, template, utility and doc) was read end-to-end by an 8-reader audit fleet, cross-checked against primary-source July-2026 facts and against the code itself, then fixed by a 6-worker fleet with disjoint file ownership. ~250 corrections:

- **The docs now describe the plugin that actually ships.** 135 broken `/contentforge:<name>` references repaired (skills are `cf-`-prefixed; `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` alone taught 53 commands that did not exist). Removed every claim of active hooks and pre-connected MCP servers (both ship empty by design since v3.9.0), every promise of **parallel** batch processing with a "4-5x speedup" (the orchestrator is sequential and checkpointed by design), and the fabricated performance statistics in COWORK-GUIDE. Cowork install instructions rewritten around the Plugins panel — `/plugin` commands do not exist there.
- **Contract repair between docs and code.** `cf-switch-backend` documented a backend value (`google`) the code rejects — every documented invocation failed. The Drive-upload branch keyed on the same wrong value and could never fire. `08-output-manager` documented a `--published-path` flag that does not exist, and five `--format=` outputs including a PDF with no renderer. Checkpoint metadata keys, approval payloads, quality-gate score bands, age/opportunity formulas, connector counts, and content-type taxonomies were all realigned to the implementation.
- **Two safety mechanisms that silently never ran.** The Phase 7 reviewer read loop-count keys the checkpoint manager never writes, so loop limits could not fire; the humanizer gate enforced 5 of its 6 catalog buckets, leaving patterns 30-35 unchecked.
- **Script hardening.** Path-traversal fixed in `checkpoint-manager.py` (`--run-id` reached `shutil.rmtree` unvalidated), `backend-migrator.py` and `local-tracker.py`; fictional `@anthropic/mcp-*` packages removed from `connector-status.py`; Airtable partial-success no longer duplicates records on re-run; `embed-c2pa` provenance and registry aliases brought current (balanced/fast tiers were a generation behind); atomic writes, trustworthy exit codes, and dead-code removal throughout.
- **Statistical and factual integrity.** Sample-size, freshness, opportunity and progress examples recomputed so they reproduce from their own formulas; fabricated author/institution/IRB details removed from the research-paper and whitepaper templates; FAQ/HowTo rich-result guidance corrected to the real 2023 deprecations; a nonexistent "Google March 2026 core update" removed from two agents.
- **Self-containment, everywhere.** The guard test now covers docs/, scripts/, utilities/, utils/, templates/, config/ and root docs — not just skills/agents/commands. It caught live leaks in `utilities/cms-publisher.md` (which told users to run a sibling plugin's command), the C2PA cert guide, `AGENTS.md`, `COWORK-GUIDE.md` and `generate-docx.py`; all removed.
- Tests 144 → **145**; suite green.

## [3.16.1] - 2026-07-12

### Changed - plugin self-containment

- **Removed cross-plugin capability references.** `content-refresh` no longer recommends Digital Marketing Pro skills for pre-refresh diagnosis; it now routes to ContentForge's own `cf-brief` (keyword + competitor re-research) alongside `cf-audit`. ContentForge is fully standalone.
- README suite table: corrected stale sibling stats (DMP 24 agents / 158 skills; humanizer is 35-pattern) and stated explicitly that each plugin in the suite is fully standalone.

## [3.16.0] - 2026-07-07

**The Reliability & Truth release — five-layer deep audit implemented end to end.**

A full-repo audit (orchestration, agents, skills/commands, Python scripts, configs/templates) surfaced ~120 findings; this release fixes all of them in one coordinated pass. Canonical claim is now **10 phases + Step 0.5, 10 quality gates** (previously advertised 11 with 8 defined).

### Added

- **Canonical run-directory contract**: every phase artifact saves to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand-slug}/runs/{run_id}/phase-N-*.md|json` via checkpoint-manager; SKILL.md Pipeline Contract table defines reads/writes/gate/loop-target for every phase. `/contentforge:resume` now works for skill-started runs (previously only command-started).
- **`scripts/_common.py`** — single shared slugifier (fixes the checkpoint↔drive-sync path mismatch that silently broke Cowork sync for brand names with spaces/capitals), atomic JSON writes, UTF-8 console guard (fixes Windows cp1252 crash), JSON-error exit codes across all 15 scripts.
- **`scripts/text-metrics.py`** — burstiness, Flesch-Kincaid, keyword placements, structured-element counts; quality gates are now measured, not self-certified.
- **Phase 6 → 6.5 protected-structure manifest** (`phase-6-structure-manifest.json`): the humanizer must preserve GEO answer-blocks/tables/lists or the gate fails — closes the "humanizer dismantles GEO structure" gap.
- **checkpoint-manager**: run metadata (`--keyword/--audience/--word-count/--tone/--meta`), `loop` subcommand (persistent per-edge + total loop counters), `pending_rework` (mid-loop resume returns to the rework target instead of skipping it).
- **pipeline-tracker `--run-id`** — per-run timing files; concurrent same-brand batch runs no longer clobber each other.
- **EU AI Act Article 50 disclosure step** (applicable 2026-08-02) in cf-publish: C2PA for .docx, disclosure line for CMS, platform AI-labels for social; per-platform `ai_disclosure` fields in social-platform-specs.json.
- **Humanizer patterns 30-35** (colon-subtitle headlines, false-dichotomy openers, scene-setting openers, parallel-H2 grammar, FAQ-shaped conclusions, bottom-line headers) + defined `ai_signal_scoring` formula behind the 0.3 gate. Catalog now 35 patterns.
- **Social platforms**: TikTok (incl. photo posts), Bluesky, YouTube Shorts blocks; Instagram Reels 180s; X Premium 25K note; hashtag guidance updated; posting-time folklore removed.
- **generate-docx**: image embedding (block + inline, missing-file placeholders), TOC field, "Page X of Y" footer, 1.15 line spacing, nested lists, underscore/triple-star emphasis, atomic C2PA rename.
- **90 new tests** (53 → 143): checkpoint roundtrip, path contract, text metrics, docx parser + render, pipeline tracker isolation, resolve_model semantics, _common, plus release-consistency locks (no version literals in doc bodies, every `/contentforge:*` reference resolves, thresholds config == brand template, phase/gate-count claims, social-spec keys).
- **AEO/GEO strategy section in cf-brief** (AI Overview presence, citation-worthiness, answer blocks, PAA mining, llms.txt, entity consistency); E-E-A-T folded in from the command twin.
- Industry packs: `_last_reviewed` dates, `humanizer_notes` per industry, FDA 2024 CCN rule (pharma), HHS/OCR tracking-tech guidance (healthcare), SEC Marketing Rule 206(4)-1 (bfsi), INFORM Consumers Act + EU DSA/GPSR (ecommerce).

### Changed

- **User interaction hoisted out of subagents** — title curation and image approvals are orchestrator-owned; agents return `needs_user_decision` payloads instead of waiting (subagents cannot talk to the user; previously a silent-failure point). Documented `--title` bypass for non-interactive runs.
- **Keyword-density hard gate retired** — SEO gate now checks placements (title, first 100 words, H2s, conclusion, meta); density is advisory ~1-2%. LSI-keyword advice removed everywhere.
- **Batch orchestrator honest rewrite**: sequential checkpointed queue, success = reviewer-approved ≥7.0 (5.0-6.9 routes to review, never "completed"), event-driven status instead of impossible 30-second dashboards, maxTurns 200.
- **`config/scoring-thresholds.json` is the single source of truth** for every gate number; brand template, quality scorecard, loop tracker, agents, and skills all reference it (drift-locked by tests). Word counts, source gates, readability tolerances unified.
- **Command/skill twins collapsed**: publish, social-adapt, translate, content-brief, audit-content, create-content are thin wrappers over their skills — the drifted duplicate procedure bodies (two freshness formulas, Phase 8 "Reviewer" mislabel, contradictory hashtag counts) are gone.
- Connector skills rewritten to match the shipped empty `.mcp.json` (no more "7 pre-configured connectors" fiction); all status output comes from live `connector-status.py`; unverified endpoints and fictional npm packages removed.
- Fact-checker: paywalled sources are UNVERIFIED unless corroborated; full SERP re-validation reduced to top-3 spot-check; worked example now models flag resolution before PASS.
- Scientific validator rescoped as the universal draft-vs-ledger hallucination audit (all content types) with a no-refetch fence.
- Reviewer industry weight overrides fully specified for all 5 dimensions and all 5 regulated industries.
- All worked examples labeled SYNTHETIC; fabricated real-org stats (McKinsey, Cleveland Clinic) replaced with fictional organizations.
- ~50 dangling slash-command references fixed across agents/skills/commands; `python3` → `python` throughout (Windows-first).

### Fixed

- setup.py `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` fallback never firing (Google credentials misreported).
- `resolve_model.py --check` now exits 1 for retired models.
- Airtable formula injection via brand names with apostrophes; Drive pagination past 100 files; backend-migrator lost file linkage; sheets-tracker crash on non-numeric priority; non-atomic tracker writes; corrupt-JSON recovery.
- Custom templates now save to `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` (previously written inside the plugin install dir and wiped on update).
- Stale `**Version:** 3.4.0` footers stripped from 14 skills; `~~` strikethrough artifacts removed from 6 commands; phantom `humanizer.py`/`fact-checker.py` references removed from AGENTS.md.

---

## [3.15.3] - 2026-06-28

**README-sync patch — Release notes catch-up + test-coverage extension.**

After v3.15.2 shipped, the user flagged that several README sections across the suite had stale version refs. CF's specific gap: Release notes still ended at v3.15.0 — v3.15.1 (release-consistency tests) and v3.15.2 (market refresh) had shipped without README updates.

### Fixed (CF README)

- Added v3.15.3 (this), v3.15.2, v3.15.1 entries to "## Release notes" section
- README hero callout + Supported surfaces heading + version badge all bumped to v3.15.3

### Changed

- All 9 CF version declarations 3.15.2 → 3.15.3

### Notes

- DMP's v3.14.1 patch extends its `tests/test_release_consistency.py` with section-heading + anchor-sync checks. CF's release-consistency suite already had `test_readme_supported_surfaces_section_mentions_canonical` (added in v3.15.1) — that's why CF wasn't bitten by the same heading-staleness issue DMP was.
- Zero pipeline change.

---

## [3.15.2] - 2026-06-28

**June 2026 market-refresh sync — model registry + MODEL-CURATOR docs refreshed (docs-only, no runtime change).**

Mirrors the DMP v3.14.0 suite-wide refresh. ContentForge's content pipeline already routes through the resolver, so the alias re-pointings flow through automatically.

### Added — registry-handled retired status

`scripts/resolve_model.py` now unconditionally rewrites `retired` model IDs to their `replacement_id`. Net effect: any cached config referencing now-dead model IDs (Gemini 2.0 family, Gemini 3 preview image variants, Veo 2/3 family) gets routed to the working replacement instead of HTTP 404. New test `test_retired_falls_forward_unconditionally` covers this.

### Added — `--check-params` scanner for Anthropic param 400 protection

`python scripts/resolve_model.py --check-params <file>` flags unsafe `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` near Claude Opus 4.7+ targets. Pre-flight scan of `contentforge/scripts/*.py` was clean.

### Added — model registry rebuilt against vendor primary docs

47 entries verified against Anthropic / OpenAI / Google deprecation pages. Notable adds: `claude-opus-4-8`, `gpt-5.5` family, `gpt-image-2`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Notable retired/deprecated: Gemini 2.0 family (shutdown 2026-06-01), Veo 2/3 family (shutdown 2026-06-30), Gemini 2.5 family (shutdown 2026-10-16), Imagen 4 (deprecated 2026-06-15).

### Added — `docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md` refresh

Aliases table refreshed; new § **Parameter compatibility — Claude Opus 4.7 and later** explains the HTTP 400 risk.

### Changed

- All 9 version declarations bumped 3.15.1 → 3.15.2
- README "Just shipped" callout updated for v3.15.2
- Registry `last_updated` 2026-06-28

### Tests

- 53/53 passing

---

## [3.15.1] - 2026-06-09

**Test-infrastructure polish — release-consistency suite.**

A short follow-up to v3.15.0 that hardens the release pipeline against the kinds of cross-manifest drift that escaped earlier ships. Inspired by DMP's v3.13.1 polish round.

### Added — Release-consistency test suite (`tests/test_release_consistency.py`, +30 tests)

The suite catches drift before it reaches users by checking:
- All 7 platform manifest versions are in sync (5 Claude-family + Hermes `plugin.yaml` + OpenClaw)
- The Hermes `__init__.py` `PLUGIN_VERSION` constant matches the canonical version
- The README version badge matches the canonical version
- The README `## Supported surfaces (vX.Y.Z)` section heading matches the canonical version
- The README "Just shipped — vX.Y.Z" hero callout matches the canonical version
- The CHANGELOG's most recent `## [X.Y.Z]` header matches the canonical version
- All 5 Claude-family manifest descriptions are byte-identical
- Every Claude-family description mentions the actual `21 skills` count
- The README test-count badge matches the actual count of `def test_*` methods
- All 7 native platform install commands appear verbatim in the README
- All 12 critical README sections (Why ContentForge, Supported surfaces, Quick start, What ContentForge does, Architecture, Connectors, Troubleshooting, Updating, FAQ, Cross-platform compatibility, Release notes, plus an 8-platform name-mention check) are present
- Every internal anchor link in the README resolves to a real heading

Test count: 23 → **53**. All passing.

### Changed

- README test badge bumped: `tests-23%2F23` → `tests-53%2F53`
- README hero "Just shipped" callout updated to mention v3.15.1 + new test count
- All 8 version declarations bumped to 3.15.1: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, `plugin.yaml`, `__init__.py`

### Why this matters

The v3.15.0 ship surfaced two patterns we hadn't tested for and almost shipped broken:
1. Manifest version-string drift across the 7 platform files when a release rushes
2. Section-heading staleness when the canonical version moves but the heading doesn't follow

Both are now caught by `pytest tests/test_release_consistency.py` (or `python -m unittest discover -s tests`). Zero runtime behavior change.

---

## [3.15.0] - 2026-06-09

**Multi-harness expansion: native Hermes Agent + native OpenClaw + test suite.**

Brings ContentForge into parity with DMP v3.13.0+ on cross-platform support. Every claim verified against primary platform docs.

### Added — Native Hermes Agent plugin

- **`plugin.yaml`** at repo root with required fields (name, version, description, author, license, homepage). Zero env vars, zero global hooks (matches the rest of the suite's policy).
- **`__init__.py`** at repo root exposing `register(ctx)` that Hermes calls at plugin load. Walks the `skills/` directory and exposes all 21 ContentForge skills via `ctx.register_skill(name, path)`. Defensive coding throughout — stdlib only; if Hermes API differs from spec, the adapter logs and degrades gracefully instead of crashing. Includes an `audit()` introspection function for pre-install sanity checks.
- Install command: `hermes plugins install teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu`.
- Spec source: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin
- Targets Hermes Desktop v0.15.2 (public preview June 2 2026).

### Added — Native OpenClaw manifest

- **`openclaw.plugin.json`** at repo root with required `id` + `configSchema`, optional `name`/`description`/`version`/`skills: ["./skills"]`. OpenClaw auto-detects our existing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as a Claude-compatible bundle fallback, but shipping the native manifest enables ClawHub marketplace eligibility + first-class discoverability.
- Install command: `openclaw plugins install git:github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu`.
- Spec source: https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/manifest

### Added — Test suite (0 → 23, all passing)

- **`tests/test_hermes_adapter.py`** (12 tests) covering plugin.yaml schema (name / version / semver / description / provides_hooks: [] / requires_env: []), adapter import smoke, `register()` against mock ctx (all skills register), graceful degradation when ctx is missing register_skill / is None, version consistency between plugin.yaml and __init__.py.
- **`tests/test_openclaw_manifest.py`** (11 tests) covering manifest existence, id required + kebab-case + matches Claude plugin name, configSchema validation, skills field points at ./skills directory that exists, version matches canonical Claude plugin, no unexpected top-level fields, cross-manifest version consistency.
- `tests/run_all.py` runs everything: `python tests/run_all.py` → 23/23 passing.

### Changed

- All 5 platform manifests bumped to v3.15.0. Description (where it changes) reflects new Hermes + OpenClaw support.
- README "Supported surfaces" table now has 8 rows (added Hermes Agent + OpenClaw).
- Added "Works on 35+ additional Agent Skills platforms" callout pointing at the skills/ folder for any Agent-Skills-compatible client.

### Why no breaking changes — each platform reads its own manifest path

- `plugin.yaml` read ONLY by Hermes
- `__init__.py` executed ONLY by Hermes (Claude Code doesn't auto-execute Python files)
- `openclaw.plugin.json` read ONLY by OpenClaw
- Auto-connecting MCPs unchanged (still empty `.mcp.json`)
- Global hooks unchanged (still empty `hooks/hooks.json`)
- Skill descriptions unchanged
- Claude Code + Cowork behavior byte-identical to v3.14.0

## [3.14.0] - 2026-05-27

**Distribution & context-efficiency polish — discoverability + leaner pipeline-phase loads.**

### Changed

- **Plugin descriptions trimmed to ~150 chars across all 5 manifests** (`.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.github/plugin/`, `gemini-extension.json`). Install-UI now reads as one clear sentence across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI, and Antigravity. Long-form positioning lives in README + `interface.longDescription` (Codex). Inspired by the Understand-Anything distribution pattern (35k★).
- **Skill count corrected** from "19" to actual "21" in plugin manifests + per-platform manifests.
- **README hero rewritten pain-first.** Opens with the real scenario the plugin solves ("You need to ship 30 articles this quarter that pass GPTZero, sound human, cite real sources…") then states what the plugin does.
- **GitHub repo topics curated to 20-max with platform-skill topics added**: `cursor-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`, `gemini-cli-extension` joined `claude-code` / `claude-plugin` / `openai-codex` / `agent-skills` for discoverability via GitHub's topic browser.
- **Context-efficiency callout added to the 10 heaviest skills** (`cf-style-guide`, `cf-social-adapt`, `cf-brief`, `contentforge`, `cf-analytics`, `cf-connect`, `cf-publish`, `cf-template`, `cf-audit`, `cf-integrations`). Tells the agent to grep-before-read `references/` and `humanization-patterns.json`, pass earlier-phase outputs by path + line range (not by reloading), and on `/contentforge:resume` load only the failed phase's state.

### Unchanged

- 21 skills (all frontmatter intact, names match folders, all pass Codex `[a-z0-9-]+` regex)
- 13 specialist agents
- 9 commands
- 11-phase pipeline + 11 quality gates + per-phase checkpointing
- 29-pattern AI-detection humanizer
- C2PA .docx signing
- Shared model curator + dual-copy save under `~/Documents/ContentForge/<brand>/`
- Zero global hooks, zero auto-connecting MCPs (`.mcp.json` remains gitignored)

### How to update

```bash
/plugin update contentforge@techshu
/reload-plugins
```

If on Cowork / claude.ai / Desktop: Plugins panel → Update.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-05-27

**Real native manifests for 5 verified agent surfaces.** Ships verified-real manifests for OpenAI Codex, Google Antigravity 2.0, Cursor 2.5+, and GitHub Copilot CLI — replacing the v3.11/v3.12 era invented manifests that were correctly removed in v3.12.11.

### Per-surface manifest (verified-real schemas)

| Surface | Manifest path | Schema source |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI + IDE extensions) + Anthropic Cowork | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Claude Code published format (unchanged from v3.12.11) |
| OpenAI Codex (CLI + IDE + App) | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | `developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build` |
| Cursor 2.5+ | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | `cursor.com/schemas/cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (JSON Schema draft-07) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `.github/plugin/plugin.json` | `docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-creating`. Copilot also recognizes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as documented fallback path |
| Google Antigravity 2.0 (CLI + IDE) | `gemini-extension.json` (at repo root, not `.antigravity/`) | Per Google's `gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack` reference repo |

### Added

- `gemini-extension.json` at repo root — Antigravity manifest with `contextFileName: "AGENTS.md"`. Same `skills/` directory shared with Claude Code + Codex + Cursor + Copilot via the Agent Skills open standard.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — OpenAI Codex manifest with `interface` block, points at shared `./skills/`.
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` — Cursor 2.5+ manifest per the published JSON Schema.
- `.github/plugin/plugin.json` — GitHub Copilot CLI manifest at primary path.
- `AGENTS.md` at repo root — auto-loaded by Codex + Antigravity + Copilot CLI + Cursor agent context chains.

### Verified

- All 21 ContentForge skill names pass the Codex `[a-z0-9-]` regex; SKILL.md frontmatter `name:` matches folder; descriptions ≤ 1024 chars. (Suite-wide: 190/190 across DMP + CF + SF.)
- All 4 new JSON manifests parse cleanly.

### Not changed

- Zero changes to `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`. ContentForge behavior in Claude Code + Cowork **byte-identical** to v3.12.11.
- 19 skills + 13 agents + all commands + all scripts + 16 opt-in HTTP MCP connectors all unchanged.
- v3.12.10's three Cowork-with-Drive flows (cross-session checkpoint resume, brand-profile read-back, multi-team namespace isolation) untouched.
- C2PA signing, humanizer, fact-checker, internal linking, .docx export — all unchanged.

### Caveats per platform

- **Codex subagents** are TOML; our `agents/*.md` are Claude-only as static files.
- **Copilot CLI custom slash commands not yet supported** (open issues #618 and #1113); our `commands/*.md` won't auto-discover.
- **Copilot CLI subagents** want `.agent.md` extension; our `agents/*.md` files are not auto-discovered there.
- **Antigravity slash commands** fold into skills during `agy plugin import gemini`.

## [3.12.11] - 2026-05-26

**Honest positioning: removed invented multi-platform manifests. Zero functional change for Claude Code + Cowork users.**

A May 2026 deep research pass (saved at `memory/antigravity-plugin-spec-may-2026.md` and `memory/codex-plugin-spec-may-2026.md`) confirmed that the v3.11 / v3.12 era `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.antigravity/` manifests and the GitHub Copilot CLI auto-discovery claim were all invented or unverified:

- **Antigravity** uses `gemini-extension.json` at repo root — not `.antigravity/plugin.json`. Google's reference repo (`gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack`) and the `agy plugin import gemini` migrator both confirm this.
- **OpenAI Codex** uses the `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` path (that part was right), but the schema we hand-rolled was invented. The real schema is published at `developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build`.
- **Cursor** plugin format we shipped was not a real Cursor manifest path.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** auto-discovery of `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` was unverified.

Honest position from v3.12.11 onwards: **Claude Code (CLI + IDE extensions) + Anthropic Cowork.** Real OpenAI Codex / Cursor / GitHub Copilot CLI / Google Antigravity 2.0 support is on the roadmap with research complete — build deferred.

### Removed

- `.antigravity/plugin.json` — wrong path entirely. Real Antigravity manifest is `gemini-extension.json` at repo root.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — path was right, schema was invented and would fail real Codex install.
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` — invented format.
- `docs/cross-platform-install.md` — documented install commands that did not work.

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — description rewritten to advertise Claude Code + Cowork only. Misleading keywords dropped (`openai-codex`, `cursor-plugin`, `github-copilot`, `antigravity`). Version bumped to 3.12.11.
- `README.md` — hero, badge row, "Installs on 5 coding-agent surfaces" matrix, capability table row, cross-platform compatibility table row, release notes, and credits line all updated to reflect supported surfaces (Claude Code + Cowork). The "5 platforms" badge is gone.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — platform-checkbox list reduced to Claude Code + Cowork.
- `SECURITY.md` — scope + reporting fields updated to Claude Code + Cowork only.

### Not changed

- Zero changes to `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`. ContentForge behavior in Claude Code + Cowork is byte-identical to v3.12.10.
- 19 skills, 13 agents, all commands, all scripts, 16 opt-in HTTP MCP connectors, shared model curator — all unchanged.
- v3.12.10's three Cowork-with-Drive flows (cross-session checkpoint resume, brand-profile read-back, multi-team namespace isolation) — all unchanged.
- Historical CHANGELOG entries for v3.11.0, v3.12.0 are intact below — they describe what was shipped at the time. v3.12.11 is the correction.

### Verified

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` parses cleanly (`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))"`).
- Shreea's test flows (brand-setup, create-content, resume, output-folder, cf-cowork-setup) untouched.

## [3.12.10] - 2026-05-26

**Closes the three v3.12.9 roadmap items + fixes the `/plugin` scope error.**

v3.12.9 shipped Cowork-with-Drive routing for the final `.docx` but deferred three items: (1) cross-session checkpoint resume, (2) Drive-as-input read-back of existing brand profiles, (3) multi-team namespace isolation. v3.12.10 ships all three. Also fixes a long-standing documentation error: the `/plugin` slash command family was wrongly documented as working in Cowork — it doesn't (only Claude Code CLI + IDE extension).

### Added

- **`scripts/drive-sync-state.py`** — single source of truth for the local-side state that backs the Cowork+Drive routing. Three concerns: (a) Cowork+Drive root config (per-environment, set by `cf-cowork-setup`), (b) brand profile sync state (hash-based — local `profile.json` SHA-256 vs last-uploaded hash; agent uses this to decide whether to call the Drive MCP), (c) per-run checkpoint pending list (which phase artifact files still need uploading). All actions are JSON in / JSON out. Stdlib only. Architecture note: Python scripts cannot directly call MCP tools (MCPs are exposed to the agent, not subprocess), so this script manages the local state and the agent (output-manager / resume / cf-style-guide) reads it and performs the actual Drive transfers via the connected MCP.
- **`_shared/cf_drive_sync_test_harness.py`** — 15 tests against the drive-sync-state script, covering: config round-trip, never-uploaded vs uploaded vs modified profile states, per-run pending lifecycle (add → list → mark-uploaded), aggregate `list-runs-needing-sync` query, brand-slug consistency for names with spaces, content-hash stability, error handling for missing pending file, plus 2 integration tests that verify checkpoint-manager auto-marks files for Drive sync when Cowork is configured AND skips marking when running locally. All 15 pass.

### Changed — three v3.12.9 roadmap items now closed

- **`scripts/checkpoint-manager.py` `save_phase()`** — automatically marks every saved artifact + `_manifest.json` as pending Drive upload when a Cowork+Drive config exists. Returns a `drive_sync_hint` block in the save response so the agent knows to consume the pending list. Local-mode (no Cowork config) is unchanged — no sync overhead. **Closes roadmap item 2.**
- **`agents/08-output-manager.md`** — new **Step D0b** consumes `_sync-pending.json` for the current run, iterates over pending files, uploads each via the Drive MCP to `{drive_root}/_runs/{run_id}/<file>`, and calls `drive-sync-state.py --action mark-uploaded` to record the Drive file ID. Now the full per-phase checkpoint history is in Drive — a future Cowork session can pull it for resume. **Closes roadmap item 2 (orchestration side).**
- **`commands/resume.md`** — new **Step 0** runs in Cowork+Drive mode: before listing local runs, the agent uses the Drive MCP to list `{drive_root}/_runs/`, identifies any in-progress runs that aren't yet in the local sandbox, downloads their checkpoint files from Drive into `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/runs/{run_id}/`, and then lets the normal `checkpoint-manager.py resume` flow take over. Resume now works across Cowork sessions / browser tabs / sandbox recycles. **Closes roadmap item 2 (resume side).**
- **`skills/cf-style-guide/SKILL.md`** — new **Step 0** (Drive read-back) and **Step 6.5** (Drive write-back). On entry in Cowork+Drive mode, agent searches Drive for `{drive_root}/_brands/{brand-slug}/profile.json`; if found, downloads and marks synced (skipping the whole creation flow). On create/update, uploads the new profile to Drive. **Closes roadmap item 1.**
- **`skills/cf-cowork-setup/SKILL.md`** — Step 4 now asks the user for the Drive root folder name (default: `ContentForge`). Different teams pick different folder names → automatic namespace isolation. Config is written via `drive-sync-state.py --action write-config` (the canonical writer; format stays in sync with everything else that reads the config). **Closes roadmap item 3.**

### Fixed — `/plugin` scope documentation error

Multiple docs claimed `/plugin` works in Cowork — verified wrong via Indranil's live Cowork testing on 2026-05-26. Corrected in:

- **`README.md`** — Quick start hero block, "Installs on 5 surfaces" table row, and step 1 of Quick Start all now correctly say: `/plugin` works only in Claude Code (CLI + IDE extension). In Cowork, use the Plugins panel in the UI. The Updating section is similarly corrected — Cowork is now explicitly named alongside claude.ai web and Claude Desktop as environments where `/plugin` doesn't work.
- **MEMORY note** — corrected. New rule: `/plugin` works ONLY in Claude Code (CLI + IDE extension). Cowork uses UI panel.

(CHANGELOG entries for prior versions are historical records and left intact even where they reference the old wrong rule.)

### Architecture explanation (for future contributors)

The Python ↔ agent split in this release matters. Python scripts running in Cowork's sandbox cannot directly call MCP tools — those are exposed only to Claude (the orchestrator). So every "upload to Drive" operation is split across two layers:

1. **Python side** (`drive-sync-state.py`, `checkpoint-manager.py`) — writes state markers to local sandbox FS saying "these files need uploading to Drive" or "this brand profile differs from last-synced hash".
2. **Agent side** (output-manager, cf-style-guide, resume command) — reads those markers, performs the actual Drive read/write via whichever Drive MCP is connected (Anthropic platform integration, Pipedream, Composio, Zapier, Make), then calls back into Python (`mark-uploaded` / `mark-downloaded`) to update the sync state.

This split keeps Python scripts pure (no MCP dep, fully testable from local Claude Code) while still letting Cowork orchestrate Drive transfers via MCP. The 15-test harness exercises the Python side end-to-end; the agent side is documented in the skill/command/agent definitions but only fully exercisable in actual Cowork (because the MCP tools aren't visible from local).

### Verified

- All 15 drive-sync state tests pass (config round-trip, profile hash transitions, checkpoint pending lifecycle, multi-run aggregation, brand-slug edge cases, hash stability, error handling, 2 checkpoint-manager integration tests)
- `scripts/plugin-metadata.py --section environment` correctly detects Cowork sandbox vs local Claude Code
- `scripts/checkpoint-manager.py save` returns a `drive_sync_hint` block that correctly reports `cowork_drive_configured: true/false` based on the live config state
- All previous CF v3.12.x test harnesses still pass (no regression)
- README counts still come from `scripts/plugin-metadata.py` (introduced v3.12.8 — no hardcoded staleness)

### What still needs Cowork-side validation (you / Shreea)

These flows are documented and the Python side is tested, but the actual MCP interactions can only be verified in a live Cowork session:

- Brand profile read-back: start fresh Cowork session for a brand that was previously set up; verify cf-style-guide pulls profile.json from Drive instead of re-creating
- Checkpoint resume across sessions: start a content run in Cowork session A, complete Phase 1-3, close session, open Cowork session B, run `/contentforge:resume`, verify it picks up at Phase 4
- Multi-team namespace: two teams (or two test runs) using different `drive_root_folder_name` values; verify their data doesn't mix

If any of these fail in live testing, the bug is in the agent orchestration layer (not the Python side, which is fully tested).

## [3.12.9] - 2026-05-26

**Architectural pivot: Cowork is now the recommended environment for marketing teams, with proper Google Drive routing for outputs.**

User feedback during v3.12.8 testing was direct: Cowork is the friendliest Anthropic surface for non-CLI users (most marketing teams), Claude Code CLI is too technical for everyday team use, and "I want my team to use these things on the plugin in Cowork". v3.12.8 documented Cowork as "partial support" with the workaround being "use local Claude Code instead" — which contradicts how teams actually want to work.

v3.12.9 fixes this properly by adding environment-aware output routing: when ContentForge detects it's running in Cowork AND a Google Drive MCP is connected (Anthropic platform integration, Pipedream, Composio, Zapier, or Make), file outputs are uploaded to Drive instead of the ephemeral sandbox. The pipeline runs identically; only the delivery target changes. Teams can now use Cowork as their primary ContentForge surface with full output persistence.

### Added

- **`skills/cf-cowork-setup/SKILL.md`** — `/contentforge:cf-cowork-setup` one-shot setup wizard. Verifies Cowork environment, checks for a Drive MCP (Anthropic platform integration preferred), creates the canonical Drive folder layout (`My Drive/ContentForge/_brands/`, `_runs/`, brand subfolders auto-created on first run), and stores the configuration so subsequent sessions auto-route. Run this once after install in Cowork; from then on, every `/contentforge:create-content` lands in Drive automatically. Includes the explicit "if no Drive MCP found" recovery path (Cowork → Settings → Integrations → Google Drive, 60 seconds).

### Changed

- **`agents/08-output-manager.md`** — new **Step D0** runs BEFORE the existing backend dispatch. Probes `scripts/plugin-metadata.py --section environment`. If `cowork-sandbox` is detected, scans the available tools list for any Drive MCP (Anthropic platform, Pipedream, Composio, Zapier, Make heuristics). When Drive is available, the agent uploads the final `.docx` to `My Drive/ContentForge/{brand}/{content_type}/{YYYY-MM}/{slug}.docx` via the MCP tool, captures the Drive URL, and surfaces it in the completion card — skipping the local-filesystem dispatch entirely. When no Drive MCP is available in Cowork, the completion card prominently warns the user that the file is ephemeral and offers three recovery paths (download from Cowork file panel, connect Drive integration, or switch to local Claude Code).
- **`commands/brand-setup.md`** — Step G.0 now runs the environment probe BEFORE the connector probe. The decision matrix splits on Cowork vs local: in Cowork with a Drive MCP, the brand profile is saved to Drive (`My Drive/ContentForge/_brands/{brand-slug}/profile.json`) so it persists across sessions and is team-shareable. In Cowork without Drive, the user is warned that local-only output is ephemeral and walked through the integration setup. Local Claude Code behavior is unchanged.
- **`skills/cf-environment/SKILL.md`** — the Cowork capability matrix is now split into two columns: "Cowork + Drive" (recommended for teams, all checkmarks) and "Cowork alone" (single-session only, warning). Removed the "for full functionality, switch to local Claude Code" framing — Cowork+Drive IS the full team setup as of v3.12.9.
- **`README.md` cross-platform compatibility section** rewritten to lead with **"Anthropic Cowork + Google Drive — ✅ Recommended for teams"** as the first row. Added a clear "How to pick" decision guide: marketing teams → Cowork+Drive; solo developers / content engineers → local Claude Code; strict on-prem data policies → local Claude Code. The previous v3.12.8 framing of "Cowork = Partial Support, use local instead" is replaced — Cowork is the recommended path for ContentForge's actual target audience.

### Why this matters

ContentForge's target users are marketing operators producing client deliverables at scale — not CLI-native developers. The original local-Claude-Code-first design implicitly assumed the user could navigate `~/Documents/ContentForge/` in File Explorer and was comfortable with terminal tools. Teams trying to roll ContentForge out to non-technical contributors hit this immediately: "How do I install Claude Code on every marketer's laptop?" The answer is now: you don't — they all use Cowork in a browser, which they already have, and outputs land in your team's shared Drive automatically.

### What still needs work (honest roadmap)

- **Cross-session checkpoint resume in Cowork** — the per-phase checkpoint files (`scripts/checkpoint-manager.py`) currently write to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/runs/{run-id}/` in the sandbox. For `/contentforge:resume` to work across Cowork sessions / browser tabs, the checkpoint manager needs to write to Drive too. This is the next iteration (v3.12.10).
- **Drive-as-input** — brand setup currently uploads the brand profile JSON to Drive but the read-back path (subsequent sessions reading the existing profile from Drive instead of regenerating it) requires `cf-style-guide` updates. Also queued for v3.12.10.
- **Multi-team isolation** — when multiple ContentForge users share the same Drive `_brands/` folder, there's no per-user namespacing yet. Fine for an in-house team sharing one Drive; needs work for an agency running 50+ clients.

### Verified

- Output-manager agent definition has the explicit Step D0 logic with detection heuristics for the 5 known Drive MCPs + a heuristic fallback for any tool name combining "drive" with "create"/"upload"/"write"
- brand-setup.md Step G.0 decision matrix covers all 6 combinations (Cowork+mcp, Cowork+none, Local+mcp, Local+service_account, Local+both, Local+none)
- README "How to pick" guide concretely names the three personas (marketing teams, solo developers, on-prem)
- `cf-cowork-setup` skill has explicit "if no Drive MCP" recovery (the 60-second Settings → Integrations path)
- All counts in cf-help still come from `scripts/plugin-metadata.py` (no regression to hardcoded values)

## [3.12.8] - 2026-05-26

**Fixes a real bug from the v3.12.7 production test: `/contentforge:help` was showing `Version: 3.8.0` even on a v3.12.7 install (and "13 agents · 19 skills · 9 HTTP + 19 npx connectors" — all stale).** Root cause: the cf-help skill body had hardcoded version strings and asset counts that drifted out of sync every release. Also honestly documents Cowork's filesystem sandbox limits, which surfaced during the same test (the .docx produced in Cowork didn't land in `~/Documents/ContentForge/...` because Cowork is a Linux sandbox that can't write to the Windows host).

### Added

- **`scripts/plugin-metadata.py`** — single source of truth for live plugin metadata. Sections: `version` (from plugin.json), `assets` (live count of agents/skills/commands/scripts/docs), `connectors` (count of HTTP + npx in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` and `.mcp.json.example`, plus active count from `.mcp.json`), `skills-list` (every skill with its slash command + first-line description, derived from `skills/*/SKILL.md`), `commands-list` (same for `commands/*.md`), `pipeline-phases` (derived from agent file names like `01-researcher.md`), `environment` (classifies runtime as `cowork-sandbox` / `claude-code-windows` / `claude-code-mac` / `claude-code-linux` / `unknown`, with a Cowork warning when applicable). All sections read live state — nothing hardcoded.
- **`skills/cf-environment/SKILL.md`** — new `/contentforge:cf-environment` skill. Surfaces a per-capability matrix for the current runtime: which MCP transports work (HTTP yes, npx no in Cowork), where files actually land (host vs sandbox), whether `/contentforge:resume` survives sessions, whether the full pipeline can produce its canonical filesystem layout. Recommended after install or whenever a user is confused about file paths.

### Changed

- **`skills/cf-help/SKILL.md`** rewritten as instructions, not pre-rendered content. The skill now tells Claude to run `scripts/plugin-metadata.py --section all-with-environment` first, then render the help using the live JSON values. Every count, version, and slash command name comes from the script — none baked into the skill body. When the JSON `environment.cowork_warning` is non-null, a prominent warning block is shown.
- **`skills/contentforge/SKILL.md`** — removed the stale `**Version:** 3.8.0` footer + hardcoded `Agents: 13 agents (Research, Fact Checker, ...)` list. Replaced with a comment block explaining that version + asset counts must come from `scripts/plugin-metadata.py` (never baked in).
- **`skills/cf-style-guide/SKILL.md`** — same treatment: removed stale `**Version:** 3.8.0` footer; updated 2 broken slash refs (`/contentforge:integrations` → `/contentforge:cf-integrations`, `/contentforge:switch-backend` → `/contentforge:cf-switch-backend`).
- **`README.md` — Cross-platform compatibility section rewritten.** Previously claimed Cowork was "✅ Full support". Now honest: Cowork is **⚠️ Partial support** because the Linux sandbox can't write to the user's Windows/Mac host filesystem. Specific limits enumerated (dual-copy save targets sandbox FS only, sessions don't persist, recommended use cases vs not-recommended). Tells users to run `/contentforge:cf-environment` for the per-capability matrix in their actual runtime.

### Verified

- `plugin-metadata.py --section version` returns the current install's version (3.12.8 after this commit)
- `plugin-metadata.py --section assets` returns live counts (13 agents, 19 skills, 9 commands, 14 scripts, 4 docs)
- `plugin-metadata.py --section connectors` returns 16 HTTP + 5 npx (the help skill previously claimed 9 HTTP + 19 npx — both wrong)
- `plugin-metadata.py --section environment` correctly classifies local Windows as `claude-code-windows`; Cowork sandbox heuristics (`/sessions/` / `/mnt/` / `remote-plugins` in cwd) trigger the warning
- All 6 phantom slash command references from v3.12.7 stay fixed
- `CONTENTFORGE_PUBLISH_DIR` env-var resolution still passes

### Why

User report from v3.12.7 testing (production session): "Installed version is 3.12.7. When I go to /contentforge/help, it shows 3.8.0." Plus discovered during the same test that files produced in Cowork land in the sandbox `outputs/` folder, not in `~/Documents/ContentForge/` on the host — which means the v3.12.3 dual-copy save fix doesn't actually fire in Cowork. Both issues now addressed: metadata is live (never stale) and Cowork's real behavior is documented honestly.

## [3.12.7] - 2026-05-26

**Fixes a real production gap reported during the v3.12.6 testing cycle: when a user already had a Google Drive MCP configured (Anthropic platform integration, Pipedream / Composio / Zapier / Make Drive aggregator), brand-setup ignored it and walked them through the full service-account JSON flow as if no Drive existed.** Also fixes 6 broken slash-command references in brand-setup.md that pointed to phantom commands.

### Added

- **`scripts/detect-drive-mcp.py`** — pre-flight probe for brand-setup. Reads `.mcp.json` for known Drive connectors (`google-drive` / `pipedream-google-drive` / `composio-google-drive` / `zapier-google-drive` / `make-google-drive` / `drive-mcp` / `mcp-google-drive`) AND heuristic-matches any other server whose name contains "google" + "drive". Also reads `~/.claude-marketing/google-credentials.json` for the legacy service-account route. Returns a structured `recommendation.recommended_path` of `mcp` / `service_account` / `mcp_or_service_account` / `none`. Exit code 0 if any Drive route exists, 1 if none. Stdlib only; no dependencies.

### Changed

- **`commands/brand-setup.md`** — new **Step G.0** runs `detect-drive-mcp.py` BEFORE the tracking-backend menu. If a Drive MCP is already configured, brand-setup short-circuits to a confirmation ("I see you already have <connector>; want me to use that?") and skips the entire service-account flow. The three-option menu only fires when nothing is configured.
- **`commands/brand-setup.md` Step E (Knowledge Vault verification)** — now documents two routes. Route A (MCP) asks the configured Drive MCP tool to list folder contents and parses the response; works in Cowork. Route B (service-account) calls the existing `scripts/drive-uploader.py --action verify-structure`; requires the credentials JSON. brand-setup picks the route based on what Step G.0 detected.
- **`commands/brand-setup.md` — 6 phantom slash command references fixed**:
  - `/contentforge:style-guide` (×2) → `/contentforge:cf-style-guide` (the actual skill name)
  - `/contentforge:switch-backend` (×4) → `/contentforge:cf-switch-backend`
  - `/integrations` → `/contentforge:cf-integrations`
  - Before this fix, clicking any of these would return "command not found" — even though the underlying skills existed under the `cf-` prefix.

### Verified

- `detect-drive-mcp.py` self-test:
  - empty `.mcp.json` → `recommended_path: "none"` (or `"service_account"` if creds file exists)
  - `.mcp.json` containing `pipedream-google-drive` → `recommended_path: "mcp"` with primary_connector set
  - both routes configured → `recommended_path: "mcp_or_service_account"` (defaults to MCP)
- `CONTENTFORGE_PUBLISH_DIR` env var verification — three-tier resolution still works as designed: CLI `--publish-dir` override (highest) → `CONTENTFORGE_PUBLISH_DIR` env var (middle) → `~/Documents/ContentForge/{brand}/` default (lowest).

### Why

User report from the v3.12.6 testing cycle: "Even if Google Drive is added or the Google Drive connector is saved, the Google Drive-based input/output folder structure is not getting triggered or is not properly set up at the beginning." Root cause was structural — `brand-setup.md` had no awareness of the MCP path. It assumed Drive integration meant a service-account JSON, full stop. With the autodetect, brand-setup now recognizes both routes and offers the right path based on what the user has actually configured.

## [3.12.6] - 2026-05-25

**Corrects an inaccuracy in the v3.12.5 README callout.** v3.12.5 said the `/plugin isn't available in this environment` error applies to **claude.ai web chat**. User correction: it also applies to the **Claude Desktop app** (the standard Anthropic chat client). The actual rule is: `/plugin` slash commands are supported **only** in Claude Code (CLI / IDE at claude.com/code) and Anthropic Cowork — not in the standard Claude chat app, whether browser OR installed desktop. Both return the same error.

### Changed

- **`README.md`** — re-worded the "/plugin isn't available" callout in the Updating section to name both environments accurately. Also reworded the Quick start install note (line 69) for the same correction.

## [3.12.5] - 2026-05-25

**README fix for the "claude.ai web" gotcha.** User-team feedback from Shreea (v3.12.2-cycle WhatsApp screenshot): she ran `/plugin update contentforge@techshu` in claude.ai web chat and saw `"/plugin isn't available in this environment"`. The plugin was installed (her `cf-*` skills showed up correctly), but the `/plugin` slash command itself is not supported in claude.ai web — only in Claude Code CLI / Desktop / Cowork. Our previous README did not surface this.

### Changed

- **`README.md`** — added a prominent "If you see /plugin isn't available in this environment" callout at the top of the Updating section. Documents the two recovery paths: (1) use the **Plugins** UI button at the bottom of the web chat → **Manage plugins** → Remove + Add to force a re-pull of the latest version, OR (2) switch to Claude Code CLI / Desktop / Cowork for plugin management commands. Clarifies that the plugin itself runs identically across every platform; only the management commands differ.

## [3.12.4] - 2026-05-25

**Fixes a quality bug discovered during the full production simulation of v3.12.3.** Headings in the generated `.docx` were rendering as plain bold text with manual font sizing instead of using Word's semantic `Title` / `Heading 1` / `Heading 2` / `Heading 3` paragraph styles. The end-user impact: no Navigation Pane in Word, no auto-generated Table of Contents, no PDF bookmarks when exporting to PDF, and screen readers do not recognise sections as headings (accessibility regression).

### Fixed

- **`scripts/generate-docx.py` `render_blocks()`** — H1/H2/H3 markdown headings now apply Word's `Heading 1` / `Heading 2` / `Heading 3` paragraph styles via `doc.add_heading(level=...)` instead of just bolding the text in a default paragraph. Font sizes preserved; styles now also picked up by Word's Navigation Pane, Insert > Table of Contents, PDF export-with-bookmarks, and screen-reader heading navigation.
- **Appendix headers (A/B/C/D)** in `add_appendices()` and `add_internal_link_map_appendix()` — each "Appendix X" header now uses `Heading 2`; the "APPENDICES" page header now uses `Heading 1`. Same accessibility / TOC benefit.
- **Document title** in `add_title_page()` — now uses Word's `Title` paragraph style so it's recognised as the document title by readers and PDF exporters.

### How this was caught

The full production simulation in `_shared/cf_production_simulation.py` (added in v3.12.3) extracted the XML of every produced `.docx` and counted `<w:pStyle w:val="HeadingN"/>` occurrences. The result was 0 across all 4 doc types (whitepaper, article, blog, research_paper) even though each had 7-12 H2 sections in the source markdown. The deep inspection in the simulation harness now confirms post-fix counts of Title=1, H1=1, H2=10-16, H3=0-15 per doc type depending on content depth.

### Quality verification re-ran for v3.12.4

| Doc type | Tables | H2 sections | H3 sections | Appendices A/B/C/D | Sections present |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Whitepaper (Generative AI in Cardiology) | 5 | 16 | 15 | A/B/C/D (5 INTERNAL-LINK markers) | 12/12 |
| Article (Burnout as Marketing KPI) | 4 | 10 | 0 | A/B/C | 7/7 |
| Blog (LinkedIn Patterns May 2026) | 3 | 10 | 0 | A/B/C | 7/7 |
| Research paper (Causal Inference for MMM) | 4 | 14 | 12 | A/B/C | 11/11 |

All 4 also: dual-copy save works (tracking + `~/Documents/ContentForge/`), valid Microsoft Word file (ZIP + `word/document.xml` round-trip), interruption-resume works for each at a different kill phase (whitepaper killed at phase 3, article at 6, blog at 0.5, research paper at 7), checkpoint manager preserves all saved phase artifacts.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-05-25

**Fixes two user-reported bugs from the v3.12.2 beta cycle.** Production users on Windows reported "the final file isn't saving on local drive" and "the process stops partway through with no way to resume." Both are now fixed.

### Fixed

- **Final `.docx` invisible to users (dual-copy save).** The Phase 8 output manager only wrote to `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/tracking/outputs/<year>/<month>/<slug>_v1.0.docx` — a dotfolder that Windows Explorer hides by default. End users couldn't find the file even though it was on disk. Phase 8 now writes to TWO locations:
  - **Internal tracking copy** (unchanged): `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/tracking/outputs/...` — system-of-record for `/contentforge:analytics`, `/contentforge:audit`.
  - **User-visible published copy** (new): `~/Documents/ContentForge/<brand>/<content-type>/<YYYY-MM>/<slug>.docx` — visible in Explorer / Finder / file managers by default. Override the root with the `CONTENTFORGE_PUBLISH_DIR` env var (Dropbox path, team-share mount, etc.) or `--publish-dir` on `local-tracker.py`.
  - The completion card in the conversation now quotes the **published_path** prominently with a "📂 Where your file is" callout.
- **Pipeline interruption = total loss.** The 11-phase pipeline runs 20–60 minutes end to end. If the session terminated partway through (context-window exhaustion, network blip, Ctrl-C, machine sleep), the in-memory Phase 1..N outputs were lost — there was no resume. Now every phase saves its output to `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/runs/<run_id>/phase-<N>-<phase>.{md,json}` via `scripts/checkpoint-manager.py`, and `/contentforge:resume` reloads the saved artefacts and continues from the next un-checkpointed phase.

### Added

- **`scripts/checkpoint-manager.py`** — per-phase checkpoint storage. Subcommands: `init` (start a run), `save` (write a phase output), `status`/`load` (inspect a run), `list` (all runs for a brand), `resume` (pick the latest in-progress run), `finalize` (mark a run completed/failed/abandoned), `discard` (delete a run's checkpoint dir). Atomic writes; stdlib only; works in headless / cron contexts.
- **`commands/resume.md`** — `/contentforge:resume [run-id]`. Picks the run to resume, reloads every saved phase as context for the next phase, hands control to the agent that owns the next un-checkpointed phase, and continues until Phase 8. Warns the user if `last_updated` > 7 days (sources may have moved). Lists all in-progress runs if there's ambiguity.
- **`commands/output-folder.md`** — `/contentforge:output-folder [brand]`. Prints the absolute path of the user-visible publish folder and opens it in the OS file manager (Windows `start`, macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`). Direct answer to "where did my file go?"

### Changed

- **`scripts/local-tracker.py`** — `mark_complete()` now copies the output to both the tracking AND publish locations, returns both paths in its JSON, exposes `--publish-dir` and `--skip-publish` flags. Backward compatible — older callers that only read `output_path` still work; the new `published_path` field is additive.
- **`agents/08-output-manager.md`** Phase 8 step D1 now documents the dual-copy behaviour, explicitly tells the agent to quote `published_path` (not `output_path`) when surfacing the file location to the user, and adds a "📂 Where your file is" section to the mandatory completion card.
- **`commands/create-content.md`** now has a "Checkpointing (v3.12.3+) — required for resumable runs" section between the title curation step and Phase 1, with the explicit init + per-phase save + finalize commands the orchestrator must run.

### Quality

- Per-file content sweep (`_shared/sweep_skill_quality.py`) clean across all SKILL.md / agent / reference docs.
- 12 scripts (was 11) and 9 commands (was 7); counts updated in README hero + plugin.json descriptions across all 4 manifests.

## [3.12.2] - 2026-05-25

**Model curator + correctness sweep.** Adds the shared model-selection infrastructure used across the TechShu Marketing Suite, plus correctness fixes.

### Added

- **Model curator (`scripts/model_registry.json` + `scripts/resolve_model.py` + `scripts/refresh_models.py`)** — single source of truth for AI model ids. Resolves aliases (`latest-balanced-anthropic`, `latest-vision-google`, etc.), auto-falls-forward on deprecated ids, and reports drift against live provider catalogs. See [`docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md`](docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md).

### Changed

- **Gmail / Calendar MCP endpoints** — replaced dead `gmail.mcp.claude.com` and `gcal.mcp.claude.com` URLs (HTTP 404 as of May 2026) with the working Google-hosted equivalents `gmailmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1` and `calendarmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1` in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`, `scripts/connector-status.py`, `TESTING-GUIDE.md`, `skills/cf-add-integration/SKILL.md`, and `skills/cf-connect/SKILL.md`.
- **Slash-command refs in Python error messages** — swept shorthand `/cf:X` references and rewrote to the canonical `/contentforge:X` namespace.
- **`docs/c2pa-production-cert.md`** — replaced the broken `contentauthenticity.org/community/cr-cli` URL with `opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/` and corrected the framing.

### Quality

- Per-file content sweep across all `skills/**/SKILL.md` + `agents/` + reference docs. Frontmatter, slash refs, model ids, MCP URLs, and hardcoded paths all clean.
- License compliance: MIT across all manifests; no GPL imports.

## [3.12.1] - 2026-05-24

**Polish + discoverability + community-standards pass.** Patch bump — no functional changes; no new commands, skills, agents, scripts, or MCP connectors.

### Added

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** (Contributor Covenant v2.1, adapted for the TechShu Marketing Suite scope)
- **`SECURITY.md`** with supported-versions table (3.12.x ✅, 3.11.x ⚠️, < 3.11 ❌), private-vulnerability-reporting flow via GitHub Private Security Advisories, coordinated-disclosure timeline (Day 0 ack → Day 7 assessment → Day 30 patch → Day 45 advisory), and operator hardening recommendations (don't commit `.mcp.json`, treat brand data as sensitive, rotate keys quarterly)
- **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** — 5-platform coverage checklist, version-bump-in-all-sibling-manifests reminder, primary-source-required clause for compliance updates, AI-content disclosure clause
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`** with `bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md`
- **Star History chart** in README — visual social proof via star-history.com
- **"Why ContentForge" section** with 7-row comparison table covering the 11-phase pipeline, 29-pattern AI-detection humanizer, fact-checker subagent, three-category internal linking, real `.docx` output, C2PA signing, and 5-platform portability
- **"5 coding-agent surfaces" install matrix** at the top of README
- **"About the maintainer" section** with the author website, LinkedIn and X links, other TechShu plugins, Discussions, Issues, Security
- **"Contributing" section** in README now references CoC + PR template + SECURITY.md explicitly
- **⭐ Star CTAs** at hero, maintainer section, and footer

### Changed

- **Hero rewritten** — leads with "Open-source enterprise content production pipeline" positioning, badges row (version 3.12.1, license, stars, forks, issues, last-commit, Cowork-compatible, EU AI Act Article 50 ready, 5 platforms), install command moved to top of document
- **Auto-update text** — stale version reference v3.9.5 → v3.12.1
- **TechShu Marketing Suite** table corrected: DMP "149 skills" → "150 skills"
- **plugin.json description** rewritten to lead with "Open-source enterprise content production pipeline" and include all current asset counts (19 skills, 13 agents, 11 quality gates, 29-pattern humanizer, 5-platform install). Now references techshu.ai explicitly.
- **plugin.json keywords expanded 16 → 47** for Claude marketplace + Codex/Cursor/Copilot directory search. Added: `content-pipeline`, `ai-content`, `ai-writing`, `ai-humanizer`, `anti-ai-detection`, `gptzero`, `originality-ai`, `fact-checker`, `docx-generation`, `long-form-content`, `white-papers`, `blog-writing`, `ai-mode`, `ai-overviews`, `internal-linking`, `c2pa`, `content-provenance`, `eu-ai-act`, `article-50`, `claude-code-plugin`, `claude-skills`, `agent-skills`, `anthropic-claude`, `openai-codex`, `cursor-plugin`, `github-copilot`, `antigravity`, `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `marketing-plugin`, `ai-marketing`, `neelverse`, and more.

### Fixed

- **`skills/cf-help/SKILL.md`** line 230 — "Argument Hints (16 skills)" → "(19 skills)". Stale count from when the catalog had 16; current actual is 19.

### Audit method (everything passed)

- JSON-validated all 6 manifest/config files
- Smoke-tested all 9 Python scripts via `--help` (9 pass / 0 fail)
- Verified all 19 SKILL.md files have valid `name:` + `description:` frontmatter (19 valid / 0 missing)
- Checked all internal markdown links in README.md for broken references (0 broken)

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes for existing Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI users.
- Plugin version: 3.12.0 → 3.12.1 (patch — docs + branding + community-standards files).
- All 4 sibling manifests bumped to 3.12.1.
- Skills count (19), agents count (13), commands count (7), scripts count (9): unchanged from v3.12.0.

---

## [3.12.0] - 2026-05-24

**Install-surface expansion: GitHub Copilot CLI (auto-discovered) + Google Antigravity 2.0 (experimental).** ContentForge now installs cleanly on five coding-agent surfaces from a single source repository — Claude Code (canonical), OpenAI Codex, Cursor (added v3.11), GitHub Copilot CLI, and Google Antigravity 2.0 (experimental).

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot CLI compatibility — no new manifest needed.** Copilot CLI's plugin discovery explicitly accepts `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as one of its manifest paths (alongside `.plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/plugin.json`). ContentForge's existing Claude Code manifest is therefore directly readable by Copilot CLI. Install: `copilot plugin install teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu`. The 16 opt-in HTTP MCP connectors, `hooks/hooks.json`, and SKILL.md auto-discovery all work natively.
- **`.antigravity/plugin.json`** — Experimental manifest for Google Antigravity 2.0 CLI (launched 19 May 2026, replacing Gemini CLI). Mirrors the Gemini-CLI-extensions format that Antigravity's `agy plugin import gemini` converter accepts. Includes `_status` field flagging the experimental nature.
- **`docs/cross-platform-install.md` — expanded** to cover all 5 platforms with install commands, what works natively per platform, the Antigravity caveat (spec not yet public), update commands per platform, and where to file platform-specific bugs.

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes for existing Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor users.
- Plugin version: 3.11.0 → 3.12.0 (minor bump — new install surfaces).
- Files added: 1 (`.antigravity/plugin.json`); 1 expanded (`docs/cross-platform-install.md`).
- Skills count, agents count, commands count, scripts count: unchanged from v3.11.0.

---

## [3.11.0] - 2026-05-24

**Cross-platform compatibility pack.** ContentForge now installs cleanly on three coding-agent surfaces from a single source repository — Claude Code (canonical), OpenAI Codex, and Cursor — by adding platform-native manifest files alongside the existing Claude Code manifest. No skill duplication: all three platforms read the same `skills/`, `scripts/`, `.mcp.json`, and `hooks/hooks.json`.

### Added

- **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** — OpenAI Codex plugin manifest with the `interface` block (displayName, shortDescription, longDescription, category, capabilities, defaultPrompt) Codex uses to render the plugin in its install surfaces. Points at `./skills/`, `./.mcp.json`, `./hooks/hooks.json` — same directories Claude Code reads.
- **`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`** — Cursor plugin manifest. Minimal manifest (Cursor only requires `name`) plus author, repository, license, keywords, and skills path. Cursor auto-discovers `skills/` via the open SKILL.md frontmatter standard.
- **`docs/cross-platform-install.md`** — Per-platform install commands, what works natively vs requires platform-specific configuration (notably Cursor's global mcp.json paste step for the 16 opt-in HTTP connectors), portability matrix, update commands per platform, and where to file platform-specific bugs.

### Why this works without code duplication

Agent Skills became an open standard (Dec 2025, donated to the Agentic AI Foundation; adopted by 32+ tools by May 2026). All three target platforms — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor — parse the same `name:` + `description:` SKILL.md frontmatter the same way. ContentForge's 19 skills are platform-portable as written; the v3.11 manifests are thin platform-specific wrappers around shared content.

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes for Claude Code users.
- No new dependencies — the new manifests are sibling JSON files.
- Plugin version: 3.10.0 → 3.11.0 (minor bump — new platform surfaces, no breaking changes).
- Files added: 3 (2 manifests + 1 docs).
- Skills count, agents count, commands count, scripts count: unchanged from v3.10.0.

---

## [3.10.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added — C2PA Provenance for the .docx Output (EU AI Act Article 50)

Article 50 of the EU AI Act becomes applicable **2 Aug 2026** and covers AI-generated text on matters of public interest (unless human-reviewed and the brand assumes editorial responsibility). ContentForge produces long-form text — articles, blog posts, whitepapers, FAQs, research papers — which falls in scope. v3.10 adds the technical mechanism.

#### `scripts/generate-docx.py` (MODIFIED)

New `--c2pa-sign` flag (with optional companion `--c2pa-signing-cert` / `--c2pa-signing-key`):

- **If the installed c2pa-python supports the .docx MIME** (`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`): embeds the manifest inline in the .docx file. Round-trip verified via `c2pa.Reader`.
- **Otherwise (current c2pa-python 0.32 reality):** writes a verifiable JSON-LD sidecar at `<output>.c2pa.json` with the full manifest. The .docx and the sidecar travel together; downstream tooling (or a CMS publish step that converts to PDF for production) can verify the sidecar.

**Manifest content:**
- `claim_generator_info`: ContentForge 3.10.0 + ContentForge 11-phase pipeline
- `c2pa.actions.v2` assertion with `c2pa.created` and `c2pa.edited` (the latter records "Human-reviewed via Phase 7 reviewer scorecard before delivery" — the Article 50 human-review claim)
- `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion: `@type: Article` for article/blog content, `CreativeWork` otherwise, with brand as `author.@type: Organization` and the title as `headline`
- IPTC `C2paDigitalSourceType.COMPOSITE_WITH_TRAINED_ALGORITHMIC_MEDIA` (AI-assisted + human edits, which is exactly what the 11-phase pipeline produces)

**Dev cert path:** if no signing cert is supplied, generates a 90-day self-signed cert with all the C2PA-required extensions (BasicConstraints, KeyUsage(digital_signature), ExtendedKeyUsage(emailProtection), SubjectKeyIdentifier, AuthorityKeyIdentifier). Production REQUIRES a CAI-recognized cert.

**Empirically tested:** generated a real 36,965-byte .docx + 1,312-byte sidecar manifest from a test markdown article; sidecar contains the full CreativeWork + actions assertions; script reported `c2pa_signed: true` with `c2pa_embed_status: "sidecar-only (.docx MIME not in c2pa-python supported list)"`.

### Added — May 2026 AEO reality update in Phase 6 SEO/GEO Optimizer

`agents/06-seo-geo-optimizer.md` STEP 7 (AI Overview Optimization) now opens with a "May 2026 reality check":
- Google AI Overviews appear on **~55%** of all Google searches; organic CTR on AIO queries dropped ~61%; ~58% of Google searches are zero-click
- ChatGPT search reaches ~883M MAU; AI-referred sessions jumped 527% YoY through mid-2025
- Citation source skew varies sharply by engine — Wikipedia 47.9% of ChatGPT factual cites; Reddit 46.7% of Perplexity; Google AIO over-indexes on Facebook/Yelp
- Google March 2026 core update demoted FAQPage/HowTo/Review schema rich-result eligibility on non-primary pages (reviewer rubric already reflects this since v3.9.6)
- LLMs.txt is the emerging companion standard
- Profound / Otterly / Conductor AgentStack / HubSpot AEO are the measurement platforms (no first-party HTTP MCP yet; access via Pipedream / Composio aggregators)

### Audit

`generate-docx.py` syntax-checked with `python3 -m py_compile`. End-to-end test: real 36,965-byte .docx produced + 1,312-byte sidecar manifest written with `c2pa_signed: true`. Sidecar content inspected and contains the expected manifest structure (claim_generator_info, c2pa.actions.v2 with created + edited actions, stds.schema-org.CreativeWork with Article type, Organization author, headline). c2pa-python 0.32's `Builder.get_supported_mime_types()` returns image/video/audio/PDF — .docx is not yet in the list, so the script correctly reports `embed_status: sidecar-only` and writes the verifiable sidecar; this is the honest current behavior, not a bug.

---

## [3.9.6] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed — Reflect Google March 2026 schema demotion (FAQ / HowTo / Review)

Google's March 2026 core update demoted FAQPage, HowTo, and Review schema rich-result eligibility on **non-primary pages**. Applying these schema types as supplements to articles, blog posts, landing pages, etc. no longer earns rich snippets and may be treated as a spam signal. The schema rubric in `agents/07-reviewer.md` (Dimension 4 SEO Performance, sub-item 5 Schema Markup Recommendations) was rewriting full-credit scores on FAQPage/HowTo presence regardless of host-page context. Rubric updated:

- Score 10: Article + Organization + Person/Product schema with entity-rich JSON-LD + LLMs.txt companion file
- Score 8: Article + Organization only
- Score 7: Article + FAQPage/HowTo ONLY on dedicated FAQ/how-to pages (still valuable in that context)
- Score 6: Article only
- Score 4: none
- Score 2: FAQPage/HowTo schema applied to non-FAQ/non-how-to content (post-March-2026 anti-pattern)

`skills/contentforge/evals/evals.json` BFSI test case assertion changed from "FAQ schema markup is included in SEO output" to "Schema markup appropriate to content type is included in SEO output (Article + Organization baseline; FAQPage only on dedicated FAQ pages per Google March 2026 demotion)".

(The CHANGELOG entry for v3.9.6 was missed in the original ship — backfilled here in v3.10.0.)

---

## [3.9.5] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Three-Category Internal Linking (MARKETING SEMANTICS)

Treats the pipeline as a **marketing system**, not a search-engine pipeline. Internal links now serve three distinct purposes, scored independently. The plugin recognizes that informational links alone don't drive any commercial outcome — a thought-leadership piece needs to handoff readers to the brand's revenue surfaces.

**Three categories the SEO agent now produces:**

1. **Topical** (informational) — driven by `seo_preferences.internal_linking.sitemap_url` / `page_registry` / `pillar_pages`. Points to related content on the brand's site.
2. **Commercial** (revenue) — driven by new `brand_pages.product_or_service_pages`. Links the natural anchor opportunity in body text to the relevant product / service / program page. Max 1 per product/service page, max 3 total — overcommercializing reads as promotional.
3. **Conversion** (funnel handoff) — driven by new `brand_pages.conversion_pages`. Inserts ONE audience-matched CTA near the end (request MSL, book demo, request rep visit, subscribe).
4. **Authority** (optional) — driven by new `brand_pages.authority_pages`. Hyperlinks the brand name first occurrence to the about page when content names the brand.

**Schema additions to `config/brand-registry-template.json`:**

```json
"seo_preferences": {
  ...
  "brand_pages": {
    "product_or_service_pages": [{"url", "topic", "category", "anchor_text_hints"}],
    "conversion_pages": [{"url", "purpose", "audience", "anchor_text_hints"}],
    "authority_pages": [{"url", "purpose", "audience"}]
  }
}
```

**Marker format extended** (was: single `INTERNAL-LINK` type; now: typed):

```html
<!-- INTERNAL-LINK: type=topical|commercial|conversion|authority |
     anchor="..." | url=URL_or_TBD | priority=high|medium|low |
     reason="..." | section=N [| category=...] [| audience=...] -->
```

**`url=TBD` placeholders are emitted, not silently skipped.** Even when sitemap/page_registry is missing, the SEO agent still identifies topical link opportunities and emits placeholder markers — the human reviewer fills the URL before publication.

### Changed — Phase 6 (`agents/06-seo-geo-optimizer.md`)

Step 5 rewritten as 5a (Topical) / 5b (Commercial) / 5c (Conversion) / 5d (Authority) / 5e (Quality Check). Each sub-step has explicit load → identify → place → validate flow. Anchor text rules forbid forced placements. Conversion link enforced as exactly 1, audience-matched, near the end.

### Changed — Phase 7 (`agents/07-reviewer.md`)

Internal Linking sub-dimension (item 6 in SEO Performance) split into 6a/6b/6c with independent scoring. **Removed the "Full credit (8) when no site structure is provided" free-pass rule** — that was masking a real publishability gap. Agent must emit placeholder topical markers; reviewer verifies coverage. Categories where the brand has no configuration (e.g., informational-only brand with no product pages) score N/A and are excluded from the sub-dimension average — they don't penalize, but they also don't get unearned credit.

### Changed — `scripts/generate-docx.py` (Phase 8)

- **Real inline Word hyperlinks** for every `<!-- INTERNAL-LINK -->` marker via OOXML `w:hyperlink` element + external relationship registration. Reviewers and design teams click and the URL opens.
- **Color-coded by category** so reviewers spot the three types at a glance: topical blue (`0066CC`), commercial green (`2E7D32`), conversion purple (`8E24AA`), authority slate grey (`455A64`).
- **Placeholder URLs render visibly** — bold red bracketed anchor with `[LINK TBD: <type>]` suffix so the editor knows exactly where to fill in.
- **New Appendix D — Internal Link Map** — 6-column table (#, Type, Anchor, Target URL, Section, Reason) plus coverage summary (Topical / Commercial / Conversion / Authority counts + placeholders needing URL). Marketers verify funnel coverage at a glance.
- Stdout JSON now includes `internal_links_total` and `internal_links_by_type` for downstream tooling.

### Rationale

Prior versions treated all internal links as topically-driven sitemap matches. That produces content that educates the reader and ends — a "face document" with no path to brand revenue. Real marketing content needs to handoff: informational links for engagement, commercial links for revenue, conversion link for funnel entry. v3.9.5 makes the pipeline aware of all three.

---

## [3.9.4] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed — Pipeline Orchestration + Real .docx Output (CRITICAL)

Empirical pipeline test surfaced two architectural gaps that made the plugin appear to work without actually doing the work:

1. **Pipeline did not invoke subagents.** The contentforge SKILL.md described the 11-phase pipeline but did not explicitly instruct Claude to dispatch each phase via the `Task` tool with `subagent_type=<phase-agent>`. In `claude --print` (one-shot) mode, Claude treated the description as "produce the deliverable in one inference pass" and skipped real research / fact-checking / humanizer / reviewer scoring. The output looked plausible, but `pipeline-run.json` was never created (proof: phase-tracker calls never fired) and the humanizer's 29-pattern catalog was never applied (proof: em dash count was 7, vs. the documented limit of 1-2 per 500 words).

2. **No real .docx generation.** Phase 8 output-manager described .docx structure in prose but had no concrete code path. The "output" was a markdown file with a fabricated completion card, not a Microsoft Word document.

#### Changes

- **New script: [scripts/generate-docx.py](scripts/generate-docx.py)** — produces a real Microsoft Word `.docx` from the article markdown plus a reports JSON. Auto-installs `python-docx` on first run. Handles title page, full body with H1/H2/H3 hierarchy, tables, lists, hyperlinks, code blocks, and three appendices (A: SEO Scorecard, B: Quality Scorecard, C: Production Details with phase timing, em dash count, AI signal score, factual accuracy %, etc.). Verified via smoke test: produces a valid 40 KB .docx in ~2 seconds.

- **[skills/contentforge/SKILL.md](skills/contentforge/SKILL.md) — new "Execution Protocol" section** at the top, marked CRITICAL. Tells Claude:
  - For every phase, call `Bash` to run `pipeline-tracker.py --action phase-start`
  - Then `Task` with the phase's specific `subagent_type`
  - Then `Bash` again for `--action phase-end`
  - Emit a `[PHASE-AUDIT]` line so users see real-time progress
  - On gate=FAIL, loop back (max 5)
  - Phase → subagent_type mapping table for all 11 phases
  - Final output requirements (call `generate-docx.py`, save locally if no Google Drive, surface path to user)
  - Explicit warning that single-pass generation skips quality gates and produces fake audit trails

- **[agents/08-output-manager.md](agents/08-output-manager.md) — new Step 2.0** with concrete bash commands to: (a) assemble the reports JSON, (b) write the article markdown, (c) invoke `generate-docx.py`, (d) verify the file exists and is ≥5 KB. The prose specification of document structure is preserved as reference but the script is now the canonical execution path.

#### Verification

After this release, a successful pipeline run should produce all of:
- `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/pipeline-run.json` with timing entries for every phase that ran
- `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/output/<type>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<slug>.docx` (actual Word file)
- `~/.claude-marketing/<brand>/output/<type>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<slug>-reports.json` (machine-readable)
- `[PHASE-AUDIT]` lines in the chat output for each phase
- Em dash count ≤ 1-2 per 500 words (real humanizer signal)
- Real reviewer score from the reviewer agent's 5-dimension scoring

If any of these are missing, the orchestration didn't execute — re-run with explicit "use the Task tool for each phase" reminder, or escalate as a plugin bug.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Existing markdown output paths are preserved as a fallback. The .docx is now an additional, primary deliverable. `python-docx` is auto-installed on first Phase 8 run.

---

## [3.9.3] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed — Slash Command Namespace Consistency Across All Docs and Runtime Files

Claude Code auto-namespaces plugin commands as `/<plugin-name>:<command>` based on the plugin's `name` field. ContentForge's docs and runtime files (agents, skills, commands, README, USER-GUIDE, CONNECTORS, TESTING-GUIDE, UPGRADE-GUIDE, CHANGELOG) were inconsistently using the shorter `/cf:` prefix in some places, which is not the documented Claude Code form. This release sweeps every reference to use the canonical `/contentforge:` prefix so users can copy-paste any command from any doc and have it work.

#### Changes

- **All `/cf:` references replaced with `/contentforge:`** across every `*.md` and `*.json` file in the plugin (~300 references across ~30 files including README, USER-GUIDE, TESTING-GUIDE, UPGRADE-GUIDE, CONNECTORS, CHANGELOG, all agent files, all skill SKILL.md files, all command files, eval JSON files, and config files).
- **Skill filenames preserved** — skill names like `cf-help`, `cf-style-guide`, `cf-publish` are unchanged because those are skill identifiers (used by the Skill tool), not slash command names. They appear in slash form as `/contentforge:cf-help` etc.

#### Why this matters at runtime

The replacements include AGENT files (e.g. `agents/07-reviewer.md`) which emit slash command recommendations to Claude during pipeline execution. Before this release, agents were telling Claude to invoke `/cf:audit` etc., which may not have actually fired the right command depending on Claude Code's namespace strictness. After this release, agents emit the canonical `/contentforge:audit` form that's guaranteed to work per the documented spec.

### Migration

No behavioral changes. If you've memorized `/cf:` shortcuts and they work in your environment, you can keep using them. New team members reading docs will see and learn the canonical form.

---

## [3.9.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed — Plugin Manifest Install Format (CRITICAL)

The v3.9.1 manifest hardening introduced two fields that Claude Code's plugin schema does not accept, causing `claude plugins install contentforge` to fail with "the manifest's `repository` field is an object when Claude Code expects a string." This release fixes both issues so install works.

#### Changes

- **`repository` field**: converted from npm-shorthand object form (`{type: "git", url: "..."}`) to the string URL form Claude Code's plugin schema requires. New value: `"https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/ContentForge-techshu.git"`.
- **`$schema` field removed**: although `$schema` is a standard JSON convention for editor validation, Claude Code's plugin schema parser rejects unknown top-level keys. Editor validation benefit isn't worth a broken install.

Same fixes shipped same-day to digital-marketing-pro v3.2.1, socialforge v1.5.2, and the marketplace.json (techshu v2.8.0). Anyone hitting the install error since v3.9.1 should now run `claude plugin update contentforge@techshu` to pick up v3.9.2.

### Migration

Pure manifest fix. No behavioral changes. Existing installations continue to work; the fix only affects fresh installs and re-installs.

---

## [3.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added — Cowork-Compatible Aggregator MCP Catalog

The v3.9.0 audit confirmed ContentForge works in Anthropic Cowork, with one gap: Cowork only supports HTTP MCPs, but the `.mcp.json.example` reference (used in advanced Claude Code CLI setups) ships several stdio/npx MCPs (google-sheets, google-drive, stability-ai, gemini-nanobanana, mcp-imagenate) that Cowork users cannot run. v3.9.1 adds verified HTTP MCP alternatives so Cowork teams have a documented path to every connector category.

#### New entries in [.mcp.json.connectors-reference](.mcp.json.connectors-reference)

Image/video generation (Cowork-compatible replacements for npx Stability/Gemini/Imagenate):
- **fal-ai** — endpoint and auth notes verified May 2026 (free fal.ai account; covers SD3.5, SDXL, FLUX, Imagen, Recraft, 100+ models)
- **replicate** — endpoint and auth notes verified May 2026 (free Replicate account; 1000+ models, equivalent multi-provider coverage)

Aggregator MCPs (cover services with NO first-party HTTP MCP, especially Google Sheets and Google Drive):
- **pipedream-google-sheets** — `https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/google_sheets`, OAuth on first connect
- **pipedream-google-drive** — `https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/google_drive`, OAuth on first connect (also note Anthropic's platform-level Google Drive integration in Cowork as the preferred path)
- **pipedream-generic** — template URL for any of Pipedream's 1000+ supported services
- **composio-google-sheets** — `https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets`, x-api-key header (alternative to Pipedream for teams preferring API-key auth over OAuth)
- **composio-generic** — `https://connect.composio.dev/mcp`, unified entrypoint for 500+ apps
- **zapier** — `https://mcp.zapier.com/api/v1/connect`, single endpoint exposing 8000+ Zapier integrations and 30000+ actions
- **make-com** — `https://<MAKE_ZONE>/mcp/api/v1/u/<MCP_TOKEN>/sse` template for teams running Make.com automations

#### Catalog organization

Catalog is now sectioned with `_section_*` markers: first-party SaaS, image/video generation, and aggregator MCPs. Per-entry `_auth` notes added for every connector documenting the OAuth/API-key flow. Cowork compatibility is now explicit in the file's `_readme`.

#### Plugin manifest hardening

[.claude-plugin/plugin.json](.claude-plugin/plugin.json) gained recommended fields it was missing:
- `$schema`: `https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin` (enables editor validation)
- `homepage`, `repository.url` — points to the GitHub repo
- `license`: MIT (matches the LICENSE file already shipped)
- `keywords` — 16 SEO/discoverability tags
- `author.url` — links to the author's GitHub profile

These fields bring ContentForge to parity with Digital Marketing Pro's manifest and improve discoverability in any future plugin browse UI.

### Migration

Pure additive release. No breaking changes. Existing connector setups continue to work. Cowork teams who need Google Sheets/Drive can now use the documented Pipedream or Composio entries via `cf-connect` or by manual copy from `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added — World-Class Humanizer (Phase 6.5 Overhaul)

The Phase 6.5 humanizer was benchmarked against [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (16.9k stars), itself based on Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. ContentForge's pipeline scaffolding (SEO preservation gates, burstiness math, industry compliance) was already strong. The pattern catalog was thinner. This release fixes that.

#### 1. 29-Pattern AI Detection Catalog ([config/humanization-patterns.json](config/humanization-patterns.json))

New top-level `signs_of_ai_writing_catalog` section organizes 29 distinct AI writing patterns into 5 buckets, each with `phrases_to_watch`, `problem`, `fix_strategy`, and (where useful) `example_transform`:

- **Content Patterns (6)** — significance inflation, notability puffery, superficial -ing analyses, promotional language, vague attributions, formulaic challenges/future-outlook sections
- **Language & Grammar Patterns (7)** — AI vocabulary, copula avoidance ("serves as" → "is"), negative parallelisms + tailing negations, rule of three overuse, elegant variation (synonym cycling), false ranges, passive/subjectless fragments
- **Style Patterns (6)** — em dash overuse, boldface overuse, inline-header bullet lists, title case headings, emoji decoration, curly quotation marks
- **Communication Patterns (3)** — chatbot artifacts ("I hope this helps"), knowledge-cutoff disclaimers, sycophantic tone
- **Filler & Hedging Patterns (7)** — filler phrases, excessive hedging, generic positive conclusions, hyphenated word-pair overuse, persuasive authority tropes, signposting, fragmented headers

Legacy `ai_telltale_phrases` lists are preserved for backward compatibility and cross-referenced from the new catalog.

#### 2. Em Dash Advice Reversed

Previous guidance recommended 2-3 em dashes per 500 words. Em dash overuse is a documented AI tell. New guidance: **max 1-2 per 500 words**, replace most with commas/periods/parens. The `humanization_techniques.natural_imperfections.dashes_and_parentheticals` entry now includes a warning pointer to catalog pattern #14.

#### 3. Step 1 Restructured ([agents/06.5-humanizer.md](agents/06.5-humanizer.md))

Step 1 was previously two short phrase lists (`absolutely_remove`, `use_sparingly`). It now walks the full 5-bucket, 29-pattern catalog with a one-line entry per pattern referencing the JSON detail.

#### 4. New Step 0.1 — Voice Calibration from Sample (Optional)

If the brand profile includes a `writing_sample` field, the humanizer analyzes it BEFORE applying personality profiles — sentence length pattern, word choice level, punctuation habits, paragraph openings, recurring verbal tics, transition style — and matches those patterns in the rewrite. This replaces a generic personality archetype with a real human fingerprint.

#### 5. New Step 7.5 — Self-Critique Meta-Pass (CRITICAL)

The single highest-leverage addition. After all rewrites, the humanizer asks itself "What makes the below text still obviously AI-generated?", lists 2-5 remaining tells, and makes surgical edits in response. Includes an "Add Soul" sub-step (opinions, mixed feelings, first-person observations, intentional rhythm variation) capped at 2-3 instances per 1000 words to prevent performative voice. Output a subjective remaining-AI-signal score (target ≤3).

#### Quality Gate 6.5 Updated

Two new pass/fail criteria:
- AI patterns removed across all 5 catalog buckets
- Self-critique meta-pass completed (remaining-AI-signal ≤3)

#### Compression Discipline Maintained

| File | v3.8.0 | v3.9.0 | Pre-compression baseline |
|------|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| agents/06.5-humanizer.md | 273 lines | 354 lines | 986 lines |
| config/humanization-patterns.json | 482 lines | 655 lines | n/a (config, not loaded into agent context) |

The agent grew 30% but remains 64% smaller than pre-compression. Pattern detail lives in JSON (read on-demand by the agent), not in the system prompt.

### Attribution

- Pattern catalog adapted from [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) (CC BY-SA), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup
- Catalog structure and self-critique meta-pass technique influenced by [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT)

### Changed — Plugin Hygiene (Multi-Plugin Coexistence Fixes)

Audit of the v3.8 install footprint surfaced two issues that interfered with users running multiple Claude Code plugins or working in non-ContentForge projects with ContentForge installed. As of April-May 2026, Claude Code plugin hooks and bundled MCP servers fire/connect *globally* when a plugin is enabled — there is no per-directory or per-project scoping. Earlier ContentForge versions registered global handlers that worked well inside the plugin's own context but added latency, token cost, and noise everywhere else.

#### 1. Removed All 4 Global Hooks

The previously-active SessionStart banner, PreToolUse Write/Edit hallucination check, SubagentStart rule injection, and Stop completion verification hooks have been removed from [hooks/hooks.json](hooks/hooks.json). The file now contains an empty `hooks: {}` object plus a `_readme` explaining the rationale.

The work each hook did is preserved — just at the right architectural layer:
- **Hallucination checks** → already performed by `agents/07-reviewer.md` at Phase 7, in proper context with full draft visibility
- **Brand-voice rule injection** → already encoded in each agent's instructions via the YAML frontmatter and body
- **Completion verification** → already performed by the Quality Gate criteria at the end of every phase
- **Session banner** → setup info now available on demand via `cf-help` skill instead of every Claude Code launch

The full prior hook config is preserved for reference at [hooks/hooks-reference.example.json](hooks/hooks-reference.example.json) with notes on why each hook was problematic. Users who specifically want a behavior back can copy the relevant entry into `hooks/hooks.json`.

#### 2. Empty Default `.mcp.json` (Opt-In Connector Model)

Earlier ContentForge versions shipped [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) with 9 HTTP MCP servers (Notion, Canva, Webflow, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Figma, fal-ai, Replicate) that auto-connected when the plugin was enabled. Most of these require platform-side OAuth or API keys most users have not set up — producing connection errors and noisy auth prompts on first install.

`.mcp.json` now ships with `mcpServers: {}`. The 9-server catalog with verified endpoints and per-server purpose notes lives at [.mcp.json.connectors-reference](.mcp.json.connectors-reference). Users opt in to specific connectors via:
- The existing `cf-connect` skill (interactive walkthrough)
- `/contentforge:cf-add-integration` command
- Manual copy-paste from the reference file

This eliminates the 9 unsolicited connection attempts on plugin install while keeping the full connector catalog discoverable.

#### 3. Platform Notes (April-May 2026)

Audit confirmed via current Claude Code docs that:
- Plugin manifest schema is stable; only `name` is required
- Plugin commands are auto-namespaced as `/pluginname:commandname` — bare names cannot collide
- `SubagentStart` (alongside `SubagentStop`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `Notification`, etc.) is a valid hook event
- Both `type: "command"` and `type: "prompt"` hooks are supported with no documented preference
- Plugin-bundled MCP servers auto-start with no opt-in toggle (motivating fix #2 above)
- The `source: "github"` marketplace format the user employs in `techshu` remains current

### Migration

No breaking changes to commands, skills, agents, or the pipeline. Specifically:
- All slash commands and skills work identically (auto-namespacing applies them as `/contentforge:*`)
- The Phase 6.5 humanizer continues to function — it now references the expanded 29-pattern catalog
- Brand profiles, SEO gates, industry compliance, burstiness scoring, personality profiles, and humanization report format are all preserved
- Optional `writing_sample` field can be added to brand profiles to activate Step 0.1 voice calibration

**For existing users who relied on the global hooks:** the same logic now runs in the right place (Phase 7 reviewer, agent files, Quality Gates). Output quality should be unchanged or better. If you specifically want one of the prior hooks back, copy it from `hooks/hooks-reference.example.json` into `hooks/hooks.json` — but consider whether the agent-level placement isn't already serving you.

**For existing users who configured MCP connectors:** if you previously edited `.mcp.json` to add credentials, your edits will be lost on update. Re-add only the connectors you actively use, sourced from `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`. The new opt-in default is friendlier to fresh installs and to multi-plugin setups.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed — Context Optimization, Agent Safety, Skill Budget

Major structural release to fix context window exhaustion, runaway execution, and skill discovery issues.

#### Agent Compression (57% total reduction)

All 8 oversized agents compressed by removing verbose examples and redundant text. ALL core logic, quality gates, scoring formulas, decision trees, and error handling preserved.

| Agent | Before | After | Reduction |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 07-reviewer | 1,600 | 378 | -76% |
| 06-seo-geo-optimizer | 1,048 | 319 | -70% |
| 04-scientific-validator | 1,025 | 274 | -73% |
| 08-output-manager | 996 | 433 | -57% |
| 06.5-humanizer | 986 | 273 | -72% |
| 03-content-drafter | 966 | 264 | -73% |
| 05-structurer-proofreader | 947 | 269 | -72% |
| 11-translator | 901 | 291 | -68% |
| 10-social-adapter | 865 | 287 | -67% |
| **Total (all 13 agents)** | **11,503** | **4,957** | **-57%** |

**Why this matters:** Agent files are loaded entirely into context as system prompts. The previous 1,600-line Phase 7 reviewer consumed ~6,400 tokens per invocation. At 378 lines (~1,500 tokens), Claude retains full attention on scoring logic instead of losing instructions from context overflow.

#### Agent Safety (maxTurns)

`maxTurns` added to all 13 agent frontmatter files — prevents runaway execution:
- Phase 3 (Drafter): 30 turns | Phase 9 (Batch): 50 turns
- Research, Fact-Check, Visuals, SEO, Output, Translator: 20-25 turns
- Validator, Structurer, Humanizer, Reviewer, Social: 15 turns

#### Skill Budget Optimization

- All 19 skill descriptions trimmed to <130 characters (from 130-200+). Fits within the ~15,500 character skill discovery budget.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` added to 4 more execution skills: cf-social-adapt, cf-translate, cf-switch-backend, cf-add-integration. Prevents Claude from auto-triggering side-effect skills.

### Summary

| Metric | v3.7.2 | v3.8.0 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Total agent lines | 11,503 | 4,957 (-57%) |
| Largest agent (07-reviewer) | 1,600 lines | 378 lines |
| Agents with maxTurns | 0 | 13 (all) |
| Skills <130 char description | 5 | 19 (all) |
| Execution skills with invocation safety | 1 | 5 |

## [3.7.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed — User Guidance, Phase Progress, Error Messages, Token Framing

#### User Guidance Overhaul

- **SessionStart hook** — Redesigned welcome message with numbered Quick Start (1. brand setup, 2. create content, 3. help). Explicitly tells first-time users to set up brand first. Shows `/contentforge:help` link.
- **brand-setup.md** — New "Quick Start (5 minutes)" section at top: 3 questions only (name, tone, industry). Detailed setup moved to "Full Setup (When You're Ready for More)" section below. Reduces first-time setup anxiety.
- **Troubleshooting expanded** — 6 detailed error explanations with When/Fix/Common Causes structure. New pipeline phase timing table showing all 11 phases with duration and what user sees at each step.

#### Phase Progress Indicators

- **Phase 1 (Research)** — Shows `[1/10] Phase 1: Research Agent` with title, estimated time, and what's happening
- **Phase 3 (Drafter)** — Shows `[3/10] Phase 3: Content Drafter` with title, word count target, brand, voice
- **Phase 7 (Reviewer)** — Shows `[7/10] Phase 7: Reviewer` with 5 dimensions listed, then conditional post-decision updates:
  - APPROVED: score + dimension breakdown + "Proceeding to Phase 8"
  - REVISION NEEDED: weakest dimension + loop target + estimated additional time + loop count
  - HUMAN REVIEW: issues + user options (approve/revise/restart)

#### Token Tracking Reframed

Removed "token estimate" language from all user-facing output. Replaced with genuinely useful **Pipeline Complexity** metrics:
- Content words, sources cited, quality loops, phases completed
- Tracking sheet column AF changed from "Token Estimate" to "Content Words"
- Rationale: Claude Code/Cowork users are on subscriptions, not per-token billing. Token counts give false precision. Pipeline complexity metrics help users understand relative effort.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed — Title Curation, Brand Validation, Scoring, Tracking

Major quality and consistency release addressing 31 audit findings across title generation, brand compliance, scoring, and performance tracking.

#### Title Curation Overhaul (01-researcher.md Step 0.5)

- **Quick SERP reconnaissance** before generating titles — scans top 5 competitor titles for differentiation
- **Content-type-specific angles** — blog/article/whitepaper/FAQ/research paper each get tailored title frameworks (no more one-size-fits-all)
- **Brand personality adaptation** — title language adjusts for authoritative/conversational/technical/witty/warm brands
- **Brand guardrails validation on titles** — checks prohibited terms and claims BEFORE presenting to user
- **Google SERP character limit** (≤60 chars) enforced — with character count shown per title
- **Anti-clickbait check** — curiosity-driven titles validated against content scope
- **Competitor title context** — top 3 ranking titles shown alongside options for differentiation

#### Pre-Flight Brand Validation (NEW — runs before every content production)

- **Brand completeness check** in create-content.md and contentforge SKILL.md — validates voice, guardrails, audience, industry pack before starting
- **Regulated industry enforcement** — pharma/BFSI/healthcare/legal brands with empty guardrails get explicit warning and must confirm before proceeding
- **Phase 3 (Content Drafter)** — new Step 0.1.5 validates brand profile completeness after loading; warns on empty guardrails and missing industry knowledge packs
- **Phase 5 (Structurer & Proofreader)** — guardrails pre-check: empty guardrails now report "SKIPPED" (not "PASSED"), trigger -1.0 Brand Compliance penalty in Phase 7

#### Scoring Consistency Fixes (07-reviewer.md)

- **GEO Readiness clarified** as sub-score under SEO Performance (not a phantom 6th dimension)
- **Industry threshold overrides** — explicit instructions for Phase 7 to load pharma (8.0), BFSI (7.5), healthcare (8.0), legal (8.0) minimums
- **Rounding precision defined** — all scores rounded to 1 decimal place (standard rounding)
- **Dimension minimums enforced** — content fails if ANY dimension is below its minimum, regardless of composite score
- **Empty guardrails penalty** — Brand Compliance gets -1.0 when guardrails not configured

#### Performance Tracking Fixes (08-output-manager.md)

- **Per-phase timing columns** (U through AE) added to tracking sheet — reads from pipeline-run.json
- **Token estimate column** (AF) — estimated total tokens from pipeline-tracker.py
- **Guardrails status column** (AG) — "verified" / "skipped_empty" / "minimal"
- **Pipeline performance section** in user-facing output — timing per phase, token estimates, guardrails status

#### Brand Profile Expansion

- **brand-registry-template.json** — 3 new fields: `visual_identity` (colors, fonts, image style), `content_pillars` (topic ownership), `competitor_analysis` (structured competitor data)
- **cf-style-guide** — 4 new setup steps: audience personas (Step 7), competitor analysis (Step 8), content pillars (Step 9), visual identity (Step 10)

#### Eval Coverage Expansion

- 3 new eval tests (6 total): Phase 7 scoring dimension verification, empty guardrails compliance test, title curation with brand personality test

### Summary

| Category | Issues Fixed |
|----------|-------------|
| Title curation | 7 (SERP, content-type angles, brand voice, guardrails, char limits, anti-clickbait, differentiation) |
| Brand validation | 5 (pre-flight check, Phase 3 guardrails, Phase 5 guardrails, regulated industry enforcement, completeness) |
| Scoring | 5 (GEO clarity, industry thresholds, rounding, dimension minimums, guardrails penalty) |
| Tracking | 4 (per-phase timing, token estimates, guardrails status, user-facing performance) |
| Brand template | 3 (visual_identity, content_pillars, competitor_analysis) |
| Brand setup | 4 (audience, competitors, pillars, visual identity steps) |
| Evals | 3 (scoring, guardrails, title tests) |

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added — AI Image Generation, Platform Feature Adoption, Quality Hooks

#### AI Image Generation (Optional, Human-in-the-Loop)

- **2 new HTTP MCP connectors**: fal.ai (`https://mcp.fal.ai/mcp`) and Replicate (`https://mcp.replicate.com/sse`) — work in both Cowork and Claude Code
- **3 new npx MCP servers** in `.mcp.json.example`: Stability AI (generate, edit, upscale, remove-bg), nanobanana (Gemini-powered, free tier), mcp-imagenate (multi-provider: Gemini, OpenAI, Flux)
- **Phase 3.5 Visual Asset Annotator** — New Step 1.5 (opt-in check) and Step 3.5 (AI generation):
  - Checks if image gen MCP is connected, asks user for preference (full/feature-only/none)
  - Generates feature/hero images (1200x630 OG standard) via best available MCP
  - Generates contextual illustrations and diagrams when opted in
  - Every generated image shown to user for approval before embedding
  - Guardrails: max 5 AI images per piece, no text in images, no real people/logos/copyrighted content
  - Manifest tracks `ai_generated`, `approved_by_user`, `mcp_provider`, `generation_prompt`
- **Phase 6 SEO/GEO Optimizer** — Feature image meta tag awareness: uses generated feature image for og:image if available, or notes the gap
- **Phase 8 Output Manager** — AI-generated image embedding in .docx with attribution ("Image generated by AI")
- **Phase 10 Social Adapter** — Canva MCP integration for platform-specific social graphics (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook dimensions)

#### Platform Feature Adoption

- **`effort` frontmatter** added to all 16 skills — `max` for content pipeline and batch, `high` for research/translation/video, `medium` for setup/variants/audit, `low` for help/publish/analytics/calendar/integrations
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`** persistent storage — setup.py now prefers the official plugin data directory (survives plugin updates), falls back to `~/.claude-marketing/` for backward compatibility
- **`SubagentStart` hook** — Auto-injects brand voice rules, anti-hallucination constraints, and image approval requirements into every subagent working on ContentForge content
- **`Stop` hook** — Quality gate verifying citations, URLs, word count, brand compliance, quality score, and image approval before marking any content task complete

#### Updated

- HTTP connectors: 7 → 9 (added fal.ai, Replicate)
- npx servers: 16 → 19 (added Stability AI, nanobanana, mcp-imagenate)
- Hooks: 2 → 4 (added SubagentStart, Stop)
- CONNECTORS.md: added Image Generation category
- Version references updated across all docs

### Summary

| Metric | v3.5.1 | v3.6.0 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| HTTP connectors | 7 | 9 |
| npx servers | 16 | 19 |
| Hooks | 2 | 4 |
| Skills with effort frontmatter | 0 | 16 |
| Image generation support | Charts only | Charts + AI images (opt-in) |

## [3.5.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed — Title Curation Pipeline Gap

The content production pipeline was skipping title selection — when a user provided a topic, the system would auto-generate a single title and immediately start Phase 1 Research. This wasted time and produced content anchored to titles the user never approved.

**What changed:**

- **`commands/create-content.md`** — Added mandatory Title Curation section before the pipeline. Input changed from "Topic or title" to "Topic". System now generates 4-5 title options (benefit-driven, how-to, data-driven, question-based, contrarian) and requires user selection before proceeding.

- **`skills/contentforge/SKILL.md`** — Interactive mode now includes title generation and selection as an explicit step. Quick mode also pauses for title selection. Documentation, examples, and argument-hint updated to reflect topic-first flow.

- **`agents/01-researcher.md`** — Added Step 0.5 (Title Curation) with explicit instructions: generate 4-5 titles, present to user, wait for confirmation, store as Confirmed Title. Step 1 SERP analysis now uses the confirmed title. Step 6 outline uses the confirmed title as H1 (no longer auto-generates).

- **`README.md`** — Pipeline diagram updated to show Title Curation as the first step before Phase 1.

**Why this matters:** The title anchors the entire content piece — research angle, outline structure, SEO optimization, and reader expectations all flow from it. Skipping user approval on the title meant the pipeline was building on an unvalidated foundation.

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added — Pipeline Performance Tracking + Multi-Backend I/O

- **Pipeline Performance Tracking** — Actual wall-clock timing per phase replaces placeholder estimates
  - `scripts/pipeline-tracker.py` (stdlib only) — 4 actions: init, phase-start, phase-end, get-report
  - All 10 agents instrumented with phase-start/phase-end timing calls
  - Token usage estimation: content tokens (word count × 1.33) + agent instruction tokens + configurable overhead multiplier (1.8×)
  - Phase 8 completion summary now shows real timing table with benchmark comparison + token usage estimate
  - Pipeline run data stored at `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/pipeline-run.json`
  - Multiple runs per phase tracked for feedback loops — total phase time = sum of all run durations
- **Airtable Backend** — Alternative to Google Sheets + Drive with simpler setup
  - `scripts/airtable-tracker.py` — Same 6-action interface as sheets-tracker.py (init, add-row, get-pending, get-row, update-row, mark-complete)
  - File delivery via Airtable attachments (same record, no separate uploader script needed)
  - Auth: `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` env var (Personal Access Token, ~2 min setup)
  - Auto-installs pyairtable on first run
- **Enhanced Local Backend** — Fully functional zero-auth tracking + filesystem delivery
  - `scripts/local-tracker.py` (stdlib only) — Same 6-action interface, zero dependencies
  - Organized output directories: `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/tracking/outputs/{year}/{month}/`
  - Default backend when no cloud service configured
- **Backend Migration** — Switch between backends anytime with data + file migration
  - `scripts/backend-migrator.py` — 2 actions: migrate (6 direction pairs), status
  - Migration is additive (source data never deleted), idempotent, resumable
  - `/contentforge:switch-backend` skill — Guided backend switching with validation and optional data migration
- **Brand Setup Step G: Tracking & Delivery Backend** — Users choose their backend during brand setup
  - Three options: Google Sheets + Drive (recommended for Google Workspace), Airtable (recommended for simplicity), Local (no setup required)
  - Local is default only if user explicitly skips — not silently assigned
  - Each option includes guided setup (credentials, IDs, initialization)
- **Agent 08 + Agent 09 Backend Dispatch** — All tracking/delivery operations dispatch to the configured backend
  - Agent 08 reads `tracking.backend` from brand profile and calls the appropriate tracker script
  - Agent 09 batch intake and status updates dispatch to the configured backend
- **`config/analytics-config.json`** — Added `phase_timing_benchmarks` (per-phase per-content-type in seconds) and `token_estimation` (overhead multiplier, tokens per word, agent instruction tokens per phase)
- **`config/brand-registry-template.json`** — New `tracking` section with three backend configs (google_sheets, airtable, local) replacing the legacy `google_integration` section
- **`utilities/progress-tracker.md`** — Added Phase 3.5 to phase_weights, rebalanced all weights to sum to 1.0
- **`scripts/setup.py`** — Now detects Airtable token and reports available tracking backends

### How it works

**Pipeline timing** is automatic: Phase 1 initializes the pipeline run file, each phase records start/end timestamps, and Phase 8 retrieves the timing report for the completion summary. The timing table shows actual wall-clock time, benchmark comparison, pass/fail status, and iteration count per phase.

**Backend selection** happens during brand setup (Step G of `/contentforge:style-guide`). Users choose between Google Sheets + Drive, Airtable, or Local. The choice is stored in the brand profile's `tracking.backend` field. All agents dispatch to the configured backend automatically.

**Backend migration** via `/contentforge:switch-backend` validates the target backend, offers to migrate existing records and files, updates the brand profile, and confirms the switch. Source data is never deleted.

### Technical Specifications

**New Scripts:** 4 (pipeline-tracker.py, airtable-tracker.py, local-tracker.py, backend-migrator.py)
**New Skills:** 1 (cf-switch-backend)
**Modified Agents:** 12 (all 10 pipeline agents + batch orchestrator + output manager backend dispatch)
**Modified Configs:** 2 (analytics-config.json, brand-registry-template.json)
**Modified Utilities:** 1 (progress-tracker.md)
**Modified Skills:** 1 (cf-style-guide with Step G)
**Total New Files:** 5
**Total Modified Files:** 16

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added — Skill Platform Enhancements

- **`argument-hint`** added to all 16 user-invocable skills — provides autocomplete hints in the Skills UI (e.g., `"topic" --type=article --brand=name`, `[--pipeline | --skills | --examples]`)
- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** added to `/contentforge:publish` — prevents Claude from auto-triggering the publish skill; user must explicitly invoke it
- **`evals/evals.json`** added to 3 key skills (contentforge, cf-brief, cf-style-guide) — structured test cases with prompts, expected outputs, and quantitative/qualitative assertions for quality benchmarking
- **`name` field** added to `cf-help` skill frontmatter (was missing, could cause registration failure)

### How it works

**Argument hints** appear as placeholder text in the Skills UI, showing what arguments each skill accepts. For example, `/contentforge` shows `"topic" --type=article --brand=name` and `/contentforge:brief` shows `"topic or keyword" [--depth=deep]`.

**Execution safety** on `/contentforge:publish` ensures content cannot be published to external platforms without the user explicitly invoking the command. This complements the existing MCP write approval hook.

**Evals** provide reproducible test cases for key skills. Each eval includes a realistic prompt, expected output description, and assertions (quantitative/qualitative). Located at `skills/{skill-name}/evals/evals.json`.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added — Google Sheets Tracking & Google Drive Delivery

- **`scripts/sheets-tracker.py`** — Google Sheets API integration via service account (gspread)
  - Operations: init, add-row, get-pending, get-row, update-row, mark-complete
  - 20-column tracking schema: requirement_id through notes
  - Auto-installs gspread + google-auth on first run
  - Safe requirement_id generation using max existing ID (avoids collisions after row deletions)
  - Priority validation (clamped 1-5) and crash-safe sorting
- **`scripts/drive-uploader.py`** — Google Drive file upload with organized folder hierarchies
  - Operations: upload, ensure-folders, list, upload-assets

  - Client-side folder name matching (safe for brand names with apostrophes)
  - Auto-installs google-api-python-client + google-auth on first run
- **Agent 08 (Output Manager)** — Updated with script-based Google Drive upload + Sheets tracking
  - Prerequisites stored once in brand profile (`google_integration` section)
  - Error checking between script calls with local fallback
  - Setup guidance when credentials not configured
- **Agent 09 (Batch Orchestrator)** — Updated to use sheets-tracker.py for intake + status tracking
- **`setup.py`** — Now checks Google credentials and pip packages on session start
- **`connector-status.py`** — New "script" transport type for Google Sheets/Drive
- **Brand profile** — Added `google_integration` section (credentials_path, tracking_sheet_id, drive_output_folder_id)

### Why Scripts Instead of MCP

Google Sheets has NO HTTP MCP endpoint. Google Drive has NO HTTP MCP endpoint (only native platform integration for read-only). Python scripts with service account credentials are the only approach that works in both Cowork VM and Claude Code.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed — HTTP Connector Architecture

Rebuilds the MCP integration layer to follow Anthropic's official plugin pattern — HTTP-only connectors that work in both Cowork and Claude Code.

- **New `.mcp.json` with 6 HTTP connectors**: Notion, Canva, Webflow, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar — all `"type": "http"`, all work through Cowork's VM NAT
- **New `CONNECTORS.md`** documenting connector categories with `~~category` placeholder pattern
- **`.mcp.json.example` preserved** for Claude Code users who need Google Sheets and Google Drive (npx only)
- **Minimal `plugin.json`** — stripped to 4 fields (name, version, description, author) matching Anthropic's official format. Removed `category`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`

### Fixed

- **Agent names normalized to kebab-case** — all 10 agents now use lowercase kebab-case names (e.g., "content-drafter" instead of "Content Drafter") for proper Cowork routing
- **Removed non-standard `skill_type: command`** from all 3 skill frontmatter files — field is not in the official plugin spec

## [2.0.2] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed — Cowork Compatibility & Agent Accuracy

- **Added YAML frontmatter to all 10 agent files** — Claude Cowork requires `name` and `description` fields in YAML frontmatter for agent routing. All agents (01-researcher through 09-batch-orchestrator) now have proper frontmatter
- **Replaced 5 invented MCP tool names in Output Manager** — Agent 08 referenced non-existent MCP tools (`mcp_google-drive_list_folders`, `mcp_google-drive_create_folder`, `mcp_google-drive_upload_file`, `mcp_google-sheets_read_row`, `mcp_google-sheets_update_row`). Replaced with adaptive MCP approach that detects available tools at runtime and falls back to local output when MCP is unavailable
- **Fixed agent count**: plugin description now correctly states 10 agents (was "9-phase" which undercounted Agent 06.5 Humanizer)

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-17

### 🐛 Fixed

**CRITICAL: Marketplace Installation Issues**
- **Removed invalid skills array from plugin.json** — Plugin declared 7 skills but only 3 existed (`contentforge`, `batch-process`, `content-refresh`), causing marketplace validation failures and installation issues in Cowork
- **Removed non-standard plugin.json fields** — `capabilities`, `requirements`, `target_users`, `use_cases`, `performance` were not part of the official Claude Code plugin schema and may have caused validation issues
- **Skills now auto-discovered** — Following official plugin architecture, skills are discovered from `skills/` directory without explicit declaration

### ✨ Added

- **hooks.json configuration** — Added SessionStart banner and PreToolUse hallucination detection (scans for fabricated statistics, placeholder URLs, unsubstantiated claims)
- **Proper plugin structure** — Now follows official Claude Code plugin reference exactly

### 🧹 Cleaned

- Removed legacy `SKILL.md` at root (skills should only be in `skills/` subdirectories)
- Removed backup files (`.mcp.json.example.backup`)
- Removed temporary release files (`release-notes-v2.0.0.md`)

### 📝 Technical Notes

This patch release resolves the core installation and management issues reported in Cowork:
- "Manage Plugin" redirecting instead of opening management UI ✅ FIXED
- Marketplace showing plugin but installation failing ✅ FIXED
- Plugin asking to install again after already installed ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause:** Plugin manifest declared skills that didn't exist as files, violating marketplace validation rules.
